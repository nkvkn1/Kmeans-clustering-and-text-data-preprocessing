1,"FRANCE WILL FIGHT EC FARM PROPOSALS - MINISTER French Agricultural Minister Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject proposed reforms of the European Community , EC , cereals , sugar and oilseeds sectors , which he said would disrupt these markets . The EC Commission ' s proposals to shorten the intervention period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in lower real prices for producers , he told farmers here . "" I give you my word that France , while it will not reject technical adjustments or serious discussion , will simply reply in the negative to these bad reforms ,"" Guillaume told the annual conference of the country ' s major farm union , FNSEA ( Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles ). Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling EC output and fix farm prices for 1987 / 88 . Relations between the government and farmers have become strained in France in recent months . There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and further cutbacks in Community milk output . But Guillaume ' s warning that he would reject reorganisation of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the FNSEA ' s farmers . His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary Compensatory Amounts , MCA ' s , however , are unlikely to avoid further protests by producers . Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad against the EC Commission ' s proposals to overhaul the farm sector . "" The Minister ' s proposals back up our determination to organise union action in the coming weeks ,"" he told reporters , adding that this could also act in Guillaume ' s favour on a ministerial level . Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being appointed farm minister last spring . Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister . There have been certain advances on cutting production costs , reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid , but there are still areas where more could be done such as on farmers ' indebtedness , he said . Guillaume told the conference the government will make available 2 . 4 billion francs ( 396 mln dlrs ) to help producers reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire . The government has already announced financial aid for the milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package announced today was new aid , Lacombe said ."

4,"USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES REPORT Corn sales of 2 , 806 , 300 tonnes in the week ended March 19 were the highest level since mid - November , 1979 , the U . S . Agriculture Department said . The department said the USSR dominated the week ' s activity with purchases of 1 . 4 mln tonnes ( which were earlier reported under the daily reporting system ). Other large increaes were posted for Japan and unknown destinations , it said . Taiwan purchased 296 , 300 tonnes for the 1986 / 87 season and 170 , 000 tonnes for the 1987 / 88 season , it said . Wheat sales of 317 , 200 tonnes for the current season and 125 , 000 tonnes for the 1987 / 88 season were down about one - third from the preceding week and the four - week average . Wheat sales to China of 60 , 000 tonnes were switched from 1986 / 87 to the 1987 / 88 season , it noted . Soybean sales of 483 , 100 tonnes were 11 pct above the prior week and two - thirds above the four - week average . Japan , the Netherlands , Mexico and Portugal were the main buyers , the department said . Soybean cake and meal sales of 289 , 400 tonnes were two - thirds above the previous week and the largest of the marketing year , with Venezuela the dominant purchaser . Sales activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 4 , 400 tonnes , as reductions for unknown destinations more than offset increases for Canada , the Dominican Republic and Panama , the department said . Cotton sales of 57 , 900 running bales -- 43 , 800 bales for the current year and 14 , 200 bales for the 1987 / 88 season -- were off 25 pct from the previous week and 50 pct from the four - week average .

5,"INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP India is searching for non - communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange . Wheat , tobacco , tea , coffee , jute , engineering and electronic goods , as well as minerals including iron ore , are all on offer in return for crude oil , petroleum products , chemicals , steel and machinery , trade sources told Reuters . Most of the impetus behind countertrade , which began in 1984 , comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp ( STC ) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp ( MMTC ). "" The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports ,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said , adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading . One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports . However , countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India ' s total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18 . 53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December , the sources said . Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India ' s 25 . 65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985 / 86 ended March , against almost nothing in 1984 / 85 , official figures show . However , the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non - convertible Indian rupees , the sources said . Total trade with the Soviet Union , involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil , is estimated at 3 . 04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986 / 87 , against three billion in 1985 / 86 . Indian countertrade , which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country ' s large trade deficit , is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia , Venezuela and Brazil , the trade sources said . The trade deficit , which hit an estimated record 6 . 96 billion dlrs in 1985 / 86 , is expected to decline to 5 . 6 billion in the current fiscal year . But the push to include non - communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors , including the slow growth of foreign reserves , a tight debt repayment schedule , shrinking aid and trade protectionism , businessmen said . One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past , when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules . As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ), India cannot officially support bartering . The MMTC ' s recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails . "" MMTC ' s recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India ,"" a trade official said , adding that the policy remains flexible . "" We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India ,"" the trade official said . Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft , ships , drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return , the trade sources said . Illustrating the point , the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state - run Oil and Natural Gas Commission . In return , the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract , against the 25 pct sought by New Delhi , the trade official said . "" We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest ,"" he added . Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign currency to import goods . India has signed a trade protocol to buy up to 15 , 000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in exchange for Indian goods , including jute bags and cars . But despite India ' s new drive , countertrade has some inherent problems , they added . "" It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced ,"" one trade source said . "" The other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants ."" Another added , "" Barter is also restrictive . We look upon it as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty . "" This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India . It does not even figure in the country ' s foreign trade policy ."""

8,"SOUTH AFRICAN MAIZE ESTIMATE CALLED CONSERVATIVE The South African government ' s maize production estimate of 7 . 8 mln tonnes for the current year is "" rather too conservative ,"" leading grain and produce merchants Kahn and Kahn Pty Ltd said . The company , in a detailed report , estimated the harvest as high as 8 . 3 mln tonnes and said if this forecast is met the ostensible surplus for export will be approximately 2 . 25 mln tonnes . "" This paradoxically is creating a problem for the Maize Board ,"" Kahn and Kahn said . It said the maize export price currently is depressed and the board is "" probably confronted with the necessity to maintain or slightly increase the internal price of maize again ... To offset the ostensible loss which must be faced "" on exporting surplus amounts ."

11,"LOWER ASCS CORN PRICES TO AFFECT TEN STATES The Agriculture Department ' s widening of Louisiana gulf differentials will affect county posted prices for number two yellow corn in ten states , a USDA official said . All counties in Iowa will be affected , as will counties which use the gulf to price corn in Illinois , Indiana , Tennessee , Kentucky , Missouri , Mississippi , Arkansas , Alabama and Louisiana , said Ron Burgess , Deputy Director of Commodity Operations Division for the USDA . USDA last night notified the grain industry that effective immediately , all gulf differentials used to price interior corn would be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts , depending on what the differential is . USDA ' s action was taken to lower excessively high posted county prices for corn caused by high gulf prices . "" We ' ve been following this Louisiana gulf situation for a month , and we don ' t think it ' s going to get back in line in any nearby time ,"" Burgess said . Burgess said USDA will probably narrow back the gulf differentials when and if Gulf prices recede . "" If we ' re off the mark now because we ' re too high , wouldn ' t we be as much off the mark if we ' re too low ?"" he said . While forecasting more adjustments if Gulf prices fall , Burgess said no other changes in USDA ' s price system are being planned right now . "" We don ' t tinker . We don ' t make changes lightly , and we don ' t make changes often ,"" he said ."

The report , dated March 25 , said imports in the 1987 / 88 season are projected at 8 . 0 mln tonnes , 1 . 0 mln tonnes above the the current season ' s estimate . Imports from the United States are estimated at 1 . 5 mln tonnes compared to only 150 , 000 tonnes estimated for the 1986 / 87 year , it said . After travelling to major wheat producing areas and obtaining more information on the planted area , the total planted area was estimated down 290 , 000 hectares due to the dry fall , it said . The report said to compensate for the below normal precipitation irrigation has increased as has the use of fertilizer . While there are pockets where irrigation is not possible , most of the wheat crop has access to some water and therefore has emerged from dormancy and is doing well , the report said . It said scattered rain in many parts of China in the past 10 days has improved the situation but information on hail damage in Anhui is incomplete ."

15,"COLD AIR A THREAT TO SOME U . S . HARD WHEAT AREAS A cold air mass working its way south from Canada may pose a threat to developing hard red winter wheat in Oklahoma , according to Eugene Krenzler , wheat specialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension . "" There is some threat . Some of the crop is far enough along so that it ' s probably vulnerable ,"" Krenzler said . Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air moving from the north could put temperatures in the middle 20 ' s fahrenheit as early as tonight , depending on development of a low pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall the system . If impeded by the low - pressure area , the cold air could hit Oklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning . Temperatures could stay in the mid - 20 ' s for up to eight hours , Mohler said . Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crop has advanced to boot stage . The closer to that stage the more vulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather , he said . "" We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26 degrees ( fahrenheit ),"" Krenzler said , "" as long as we don ' t have a lot of wind ."" "" If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I ' d say we have a good chance of significant damage to the heads ,"" he said . Krenzler said early planted stands in the north - central and southwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable . Crops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developed and have some snow cover protection from the cold , he noted ."

18,"U . S . SEES MORE HARMONY IN TALKS WITH FRANCE The U . S . Expects more harmonious talks than usual during French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac ' s first official visit this week as frequently rancorous disputes between the two countries begin to fade . "" The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past , the trade war didn ' t happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperation on terrorism ,"" one U . S . Official told Reuters . "" It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect , more harmonious than usual ."" Since taking office a year ago , Chirac has been obliged to deal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the United States . During the U . S . Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in Libya last April , France refused to allow British - based U . S . Planes to overfly its territory , forcing them to take a circuitous route . That angered Washington . The U . S . Officials , who asked not to be identified , said a year ago Washington felt the French were not taking strong enough action against terrorism . "" Now they are . We ' re pleased and they are pleased that we are pleased ,"" one said . More recently , a dispute over U . S . Access to the grain markets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European Community threatened to become a trade war . In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate Community moves to exclude U . S . Grain , the United States was poised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food imports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute . Last week , the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad , supported , trained and armed by Paris and Washington , scored a major success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases in northern Chad . A French official added : "" There is also a common interest in getting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the world by opening up its markets ."" Although relations have improved markedly between the two countries , many irritants remain . At the top of the list is the Community ' s common agricultural policy ( CAP ). To Washington , as one official put it , "" CAP is the root of all evil "" in international food trade because it subsidises farmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below world prices , thereby eating into U . S . Markets ."

Some said the makers were seen buying some 30 pct of their requirements , estimated at about three mln tonnes for the three - month shipment period .

22,"SRI LANKA APPEALS FOR DROUGHT RELIEF AID Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries for emergency aid to help 2 . 4 mln villagers affected by the country ' s worst drought in 36 years , government officials said . Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid needed for a sixth of Sri Lanka ' s population in 13 districts . The letter said the government had to step in "" to avert serious economic hardship "" and because the Social Services Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas . The letter said 548 . 76 mln rupees were needed for a six month period , at least until the May - September ( Yala ) rice crop was harvested . Over 25 , 000 tonnes of wheat , rice , flour and other cereals were required , it said , along with supplies of sugar , lentils , dried or canned fish and milk . In some of the most seriously affected districts , the Maha ( October 1986 - April 1987 ) crop had been "" almost completely devastated ,"" the letter said . Maha paddy output was now estimated at 70 mln bushels , 20 mln less than originally expected . There were two scenarios for the Yala crop , with a high forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate rainfall within the next three to four weeks . "" Should the present drought continue , however , production is estimated at around 20 mln bushels ,"" the letter added . Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90 and 110 mln bushels , or 1 . 35 to 1 . 65 mln tonnes of rice . Last year ' s output was 124 mln bushels , down from 127 mln in 1985 . The letter said villagers in most seriously affected districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because subsidiary crops had also failed . It said the government ' s current budget did not permit it to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected . "" Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity prices and slowing of the economy . Defence commitments continue to exert pressure on the expenditure side ."" The 548 . 76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per month for each family , as well as handling , transport and distribution of emergency food . But such an outlay of funds by the government would not be possible without seriously impairing development projects , or "" greatly fuelling inflation "" in the economy , the letter said . The letter said the Food Department would be able to release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the immediate cereal requirements "" provided such stocks are replaced subsequently ."" The Meteorological Department said the country was experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four - month dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when the monsoon rains fell in late May . The letter said some areas had been experiencing the drought since August , and in the rice growing district of Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June 1986 ."

24,"YUGOSLAVIA WHEAT FREE OF WINTERKILL - USDA There was no evidence of winterkill in Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line running northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor , the U . S . Agriculture Department ' s counselor in Belgrade said in a field report . The report , dated February 26 , said there is evidence of delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall because of dry conditions . However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on last fall ' s late seeding , it said . Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early , the report said . Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage under these conditions , they said . The report said all wheat farmers contacted during the field trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it emerged from winter ."

34,"COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET Consuming countries , chastened by the collapse of International Tin Council ( ITC ) price support operations in 1985 , are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving , a Reuter survey showed . They want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords ' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non - members undermining the pacts . Consumers and producers , mindful of ITC buffer stock losses , have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations . Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case , the survey showed . The International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) last week set precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager ( BSM ) could do under the new agreement . It imposed daily and weekly purchase limits , prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets and stipulated , after consumer insistence , that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non - member cocoa . This will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia , the world ' s fourth largest producer , undermining the market . The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades . A new International Natural Rubber Agreement ( INRA ) was adopted earlier this month in Geneva . Importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations . Direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases . Bank financing was a particular feature of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling . Legal wrangles continue . Recent International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) negotiations in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality , commodity analysts said . Consumers and a small group of producers argued that "" objective criteria "" should be used to define export quota shares , which would have meant a reduction in the share of Brazil , the world ' s leading producer . Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct . The talks broke down and , although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today , delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote . International agreements exist for sugar and wheat . These do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements , collect statistics and draw up market analyses . Analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth , while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat . An alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups , made up of governments with advice from industry , such as those for lead and zinc and rubber . The U . N . Common fund for commodities , with a planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs , has failed to become operational because neither the U . S . Nor the Soviet Union has ratified it . U . S . Officials in Washington said the U . S . Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives , citing the lack of widespread support . U . S . Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case . U . S . Officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound , market - oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests . "" We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose long - term trend is downward ,"" official Administration policy states . The U . S . Currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement ( ICA ) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts . The U . S . Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries , the State Department said . U . S . Officials singled out the INRA as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working . U . S . Negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement , U . S . Officials said . Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case . Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country , the world ' s top producer of rubber , tin and palm oil , decides its participation in international commodity pacts case by case . Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing Countries ( ATPC ) which produce 65 pct of world tin . The ATPC launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96 , 000 tonnes for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50 , 000 from 70 , 000 . Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and delegate to cocoa , wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told Reuters in London , "" Agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality , if there was full participation by producers and consumers , and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously ."" But Baron added , "" No real sanctions are available for a country that doesn ' t stick to its obligations ... The German approach is sceptical . We don ' t think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries . They were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them ."" Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements , reflecting its strong links with Third World producing countries . But recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for "" intellectual honesty "" and "" objective criteria "" have grown . British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid . It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open - ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact , they said . U . K . Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be . A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price realism in commodity pacts , adding high prices inflate supply . A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable to commodity pacts . France , a large consumer and producer of sugar , favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation , particularly regarding stocks . Indonesia ' s Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told Reuters in Jakarta : "" These agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclical .. But it ' s another matter when there are structural problems .. But we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith ."" Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements . "" The political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work ,"" Martinez Cuenca said . The head of the economics department in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry , Sebastiao do Rego Barros , told Reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market reality . If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system of quotas , with a link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices , it can work . UNCTAD spokesman Graham Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries ' ability to service debt and mean greater demand for industrialised nations ' capital goods ."

38,"KANSAS EXCHANGE HITS CFTC POSITION LIMIT PLAN The Kansas City Board of Trade , KCBT , has asked federal futures regulators to modify a proposal to raise the Chicago Board of Trade ' s , CBT , speculative position limits on wheat futures contracts , saying the plan would put the the Kansas exchange "" at a serious competitive disadvantage ."" The Commodity Futures Trading Commission , CFTC , last month proposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1 , 200 contracts all months net from 600 contracts , and to 900 contracts for any single month from 600 contracts .

A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account open interest affected by existing speculative limits in proposing to raise CBT ' s limits . KCBT said the CFTC proposal would reduce hedging efficiency , constrain growth of intermarket spreading and of the exchange ' s wheat options contract and impair its ability to attract large speculators .

40,"WEATHER HURTING YUGOSLAV WHEAT - USDA REPORT Unfavorable late winter weather conditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslavia indicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop , the U . S . embassy ' s agricultural officer in Belgrade said . The officer , who travelled through an area from Belgrade to Subotica , said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crop had been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spell that followed a period of warm weather . He said unseasonably warm weather in late February that brought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early was followed by three weeks of unusually cold weather . Damaging effects were seen in the fields , most of which show stands with a yellow - brown cast indicating extensive leaf and possible root damage from repeated freezings , he said . The report said that since much of the early growth in February was from late seeding rather than from normal development , his view was that the damage may be more extensive than some local observers say . The most seriously affected fields were late - seeded fields on normal maize soils . Stands in these fields were thin and chances of recovery appeared less favorable , he said . However , he said soil moisture conditions were favorable and many of the fields had already been top - dressed , which would aid recovery ."

He said the damage was probably more limited in southern and central regions and most widespread in the north . Damage was most severe on plants above the ground where little or no snow cover was present , he added .

"" We have the potential for record breaking soybean yields this year , ( which ) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow ' s opening ,"" she said . Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible , and the crop could reach 7 . 1 billion bushels , which would be down from last year ' s 8 . 25 billion bushels . "" We ' ll need very good disappearance next year to reduce stocks ,"" she said . The USDA estimated disappearance last year at 6 . 7 billion bushels . Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the long term , "" But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks down to where we could start rebuilding prices ."" Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage report could prompt farmers to change their plans and plant more soybeans . The panelists agreed that the reports should discourage talk of revising the 1985 farm bill . "" There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm law we ' re working under today , and this report should reinforce that ,"" Frazier said . "" We are seeing the program beginning to work ,"" said Meyer ."
58,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA MUST PRESERVE FARMLAND "" If we go on using up farmland as we have done since 1980 , there will be none left in 20 years to grow grain on ."" Xu Jinfeng , a middle - aged official in Fengbang village on the edge of Shanghai , sums up the dilemma China faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes . China has to feed one quarter of the world ' s population , but only one seventh of its land is arable . Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985 , and again in 1986 . But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time , has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them . Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller amount last year . It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during the two years . "" We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the industrialisation began ,"" official Xu said . "" Since then , nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up ."" "" Last year we lost land to a new railway line ,"" Xu said . But land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses , she added . The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the Peking leadership , which announced earlier this month that China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year . "" The present situation of abusing , occupying unlawfully , wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious ,"" said an article in the official press explaining the new measures . "" It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland ,"" it said . "" China has a large population and its land resources are badly deficient ."" An official of the Shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion of only 0 . 3 hectares of arable land to other uses , while anything more than that must be approved by the city government . The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its efforts to ensure China ' s people get enough grain to eat . The prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low , making it more profitable for them to grow other crops . To offset this , the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy . The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to China ' s 200 mln city residents . Rural factories also subsidise grain output , paying farmers bonuses to grow it . Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices . Chen Zuyuan , Communist Party secretary of a village in the eastern province of Zhejiang , said the government listened too much to the demands of "" selfish city people "" and could raise city grain prices without any problem . But the government has ruled out a price rise . "" Raising the price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social stability ,"" said a China Daily editorial this month . The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term . "" We must be very careful . We have a very large population which is used to price stability and will object to price rises ,"" he said . "" The problem is how to do it ."" The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with grain and consumed by city residents . In addition , the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular . The official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves , memorial halls for ancestors and homes . Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s , farmers sign contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops , but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land . "" As the expiration date of the 15 - year contract is almost at the halfway mark , farmers are beginning to worry about the future ,"" the China Daily said in an editorial last month . Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it . For most of the period of Communist rule , the land was organised into collectives where there was little room for individual initiative . "" New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency of government policies and make them interested in long - term investment ,"" the newspaper said ."
59,"CHINA OFFICIAL CONDEMNS GOVERNMENT GRAIN POLICY The grain output of a major Chinese grain - producing province is not increasing , because farmers lack incentives , production costs are rising , storage facilities are poor and there is not enough state investment in grain , the province ' s vice - governor said . The China Daily quoted Yang Jike , vice - governor of Anhui , as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton as they could growing grain , and three times as much growing cash crops like flax . He said production costs had risen to 40 pct of farmers ' earnings , from 20 pct in 1982 , and lower investment had caused the area of irrigated land to fall . Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9 . 9 pct of the province ' s total investment , from 26 pct in 1978 . He said an estimated 1 . 5 billion yuan worth of grain was hit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year , and a further 1 . 5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats . He said government measures to deal with the problem dealt with trifles , rather than the essentials . He called for more investment in grain production , an immediate ban on illegal use of or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called the tendency to rely on grain imports . The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan , a delegate to the National People ' s Congress , attacking grain policy . He said the government had cut agricultural investment to three to four pct from 11 pct . "" With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past few years , some people got carried away , relaxing their attention to grain and cotton production ,"" he said . On Saturday , vice - premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to be self - sufficient in grain . Now it exports corn from the northeast , but it imports wheat . "" Grain consumption is rising every year . Even if we reach the 1987 target of ( 405 mln tonnes ), it cannot be considered adequate ,"" Tian said ."

71,"SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER Speculation the United States will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have reached a new level of intensity in the run - up to Secretary of State George Shultz ' visit later this month to Moscow . Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat markets since officials from the two countries held their customary , semi - annual grain talks in February . Moscow ' s decision at that time to reenter the U . S . corn market strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects . Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13 . Shultz ' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement Program , EEP , coupled with the announcement of his visit to Moscow , was interpreted by many grain trade representatives here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was preparing an offer . Administration officials -- in and out of the U . S . Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight - lipped about the prospects of a subsidy offer . But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant , suggesting that an offer , while not a "" done deal ,"" is a live possibility . Prominent U . S . grain trade representatives -- many of whom asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent . Others , who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible , are saying they would not rule one out . Rep . Pat Roberts , R - Kan ., yesterday went so far as to predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks . Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials . Richard Fritz , director of international marketing at U . S . Wheat Associates , said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month . Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat . Some grain trade representatives say a four - mln - tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of U . S . corn and open the door to U . S . sales of soybeans . As ever , one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal would appear to be price . Last summer the administration took the controversial step of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds that the 15 - dlr - per - tonne subsidy still left U . S . wheat prices far above world market prices . The administration ' s decision to set the subsidy level up front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen criticism , grain trade sources said . Nonetheless , the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz from saying the Soviets were "" chortling "" because Washington was offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to U . S . housewives . The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives here is that a general warming of relations between the two countries since last summer , combined with continued hard times in the U . S . grain belt , would favor a subsidy offer . In addition , the USSR has made it clear it would consider buying U . S . wheat if it were priced more competitively . However , observers have not forgotten the circumstances surrounding the administration ' s announcement of the wheat subsidy offer last summer . Up until the time of the announcment , congressional and industry leaders were led to believe the White House had decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not only the Soviets , but also a much broader list of countries . Instead , the administration scaled back the offer to include only the Soviets . That last - minute change of heart adds a measure of uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union ."

73,"U . S . SAID PROMISED BULK OF MAIZE EXPORT TO SPAIN The U . S . Has been promised a near monopoly of maize exports to Spain from third countries guaranteed under an agreement with the European Community , an EC official said . The official , who asked not to be named , told Reuters that the guarantee was given in an unpublished clause of the agreement . Under the accord , which began in January , third countries were guaranteed access for the next four years for two mln tonnes a year of maize to the Spanish market , as well as 300 , 000 tonnes of sorghum . However , the official said the U . S . Had been assured that almost all the exports would be reserved for its traders . The EC Commission is to ask member states to agree either a tender system to fix reduced import levies for the maize or to authorise direct imports by the Spanish intervention board .

77,"HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP Fresh , heavy rains caused further damage to the Argentine 1986 / 87 coarse grains crop in the week to yesterday , particularly in Buenos Aires province , trade sources said . They said the sunflower , maize , soybean and sorghum crops were damaged and yield estimates affected . New production forecasts were made for all these crops . The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and worsened the flooding in various parts of the province . The weather bureau said the rains , which in Buenos Aires have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days , could continue . The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains . In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of 200 mm in some parts , notably the Paso de los Libres area bordering on Uruguay . In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm in places , in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm . The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa . Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be further delayed due to dampness in the earth , the sources said . The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the crops , further dimishing the yield , the sources added . Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to 30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe , Cordoba , La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces . The production forecast for 1986 / 87 sunflowerseed has been lowered to between 2 . 2 and 2 . 4 mln tonnes , against 2 . 3 to 2 . 6 mln tonnes the previous week , making it 41 . 5 to 46 . 3 pct lower than the record 4 . 1 mln tonnes produced last season . The area sown was two to 2 . 2 mln hectares , down 29 . 9 to 36 . 3 pct on the record 3 . 14 mln hectares in 1985 / 86 . The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the area sown in Cordoba , Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires . It will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days , weather permitting . Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9 . 6 to 9 . 9 mln tonnes , against last week ' s 9 . 9 to 10 . 1 mln tonnes , down 21 . 4 to 22 . 6 pct on the 12 . 4 to 12 . 6 mln tonnes at which private producers put 1985 / 86 production . The new forecast is 22 . 7 to 25 pct down on the official figure of 12 . 8 mln tonnes for last season ' s production . The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers ' targets , against 14 to 16 pct the previous week . The production forecast was reduced to between three and 3 . 3 mln tonnes , against 3 . 2 to 3 . 5 mln tonnes last week , 21 . 4 to 26 . 8 pct down on last season ' s 4 . 1 to 4 . 2 mln tonnes . The area sown with sorghum in 1986 / 87 was 1 . 23 to 1 . 30 mln hectares , down 10 . 3 to 15 . 2 pct on the 1 . 45 mln in 1985 / 86 . The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least changed in relation to last week . It was put at a record 7 . 5 to 7 . 7 mln tonnes , against the previous 7 . 5 to 7 . 8 mln tonnes . These figures are 4 . 2 to 5 . 5 pct higher than last season ' s record of 7 . 2 to 7 . 3 mln tonnes , according to private sources , and 5 . 6 to 8 . 5 pct up on the official 7 . 1 mln tonnes . The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the sunlight needed for this crop , sources said . Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down further . The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier in the season . Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid - April in southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires ."

81,"ANALYSTS SAY USSR MAY PREFER NEW CROP U . S . WHEAT The Soviet Union would likely be more interested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking any grain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on U . S . wheat , an executive with a major grain export company said . Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchases until the condition of winter and spring crops is better known make new crop wheat more attractive , said George Hoffman , director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company . "" Pillsbury is assuming that they ( Soviets ) will be offered a subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respond to ,"" Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusiness education conference here . But if there are too many constraints placed on a subsidy offer , the USSR will take less than an anticipated four mln tonnes , he said . Hoffman said Pillsbury ' s internal statistics put Soviet Union wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidy offer . However , if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels , Moscow would likely buy more , he said . "" If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese , I expect they ' ll take it ,"" said Vernon McMinimy , director of commodity research for A . E . Staley Manufacturing Co . McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact on crops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under a subsidy offer . Soviet winter crops did not get off to a good start because of a dry autumn last year , and because of the severe winter "" they probably have had more damage due to winter weather than normal ,"" McMinimy said ."

83,"STRONG DEMAND FOR U . S . CORN IN JAPAN -- USDA Japan appears to be relying less on corn from China , Argentina and South Africa and more on supplies from the United States , the U . S . Agriculture Department said . In its World Production and Trade report , the department said in the past seven weeks reported U . S . corn sales of nearly three mln tonnes to Japan are about three times the level during this period last year . Reports of short Argentine supplies and the apparent unwillingness of the Chinese to sell at current world prices may have caused Japanese buyers to turn to the United States for corn supplies , the department said ."
84,"FRENCH SUBSIDIZED CORN FOR TUNISIA / MOROCCO - USDA U .

In its World Production and Trade report , the USDA said sales of French corn for nearby delivery have been confirmed with an export subsidy of about 145 dlrs per tonne , bringing the French price to about 72 dlrs per tonne , FOB . While this is about the same price as U . S . corn , EC corn has lower transport costs , the department noted . The French sales mark the beginning of commercial EC corn exports which could reach 750 , 000 tonnes to North Africa and the Middle East , areas which have traditionally purchased their corn needs from the United States , the department said .

89,"U . S . HOUSE PANEL EXTENDS EEP , URGES USSR OFFER The U . S . House Agriculture Committee approved proposals to extend the life of the Export Enhancement Program , EEP , through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reagan administration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union . The proposals were approved as amendments to a comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year . In addition to the amendments on EEP , the committee approved several proposals which could restrict imports of lamb , casein , sugar - containing products and tobacco . Those amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because the House Ways and Means Committee , which has overall jurisdiction over trade legislation , will oppose them , Congressional sources said . The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than the current three years through fiscal 1988 . The amendments , offered by Rep . Dan Glickman , D - Kan ., also would increase funding for the program to 2 . 5 billion dlrs from 1 . 5 billion now . Furthermore , the committee passed an amendment offered by Rep . Glickman which instructs the U . S . Agriculture Department to value EEP bonus commodities at market value , not acquisition value . Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct less expensive to operate . The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union , offered by Rep . Bob Smith , R - Ore ., does not require the administration make an offer , but urges such action . The committee approved an amendment , offered by Rep . Glenn English , D - Okla ., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to begin discussions with other major grain producing countries aimed at jointly reducing world grain production . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the amendment , saying such commodity agreements do not work . Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved by the panel , the most significant would require quotas on imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm product that is subject to U . S . quotas . The amendment , offered by Rep . Arlan Stangeland , R - Minn ., is aimed primarily at curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and foreign foods containing dairy products . It also may affect peanut , cotton and tobacco imports , Committee sources said . Another amendment would place a quota on U . S . imports of casein , a dairy product shipped to the U . S . primarily by New Zealand and Ireland . The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U . S . beef imports . Other miscellaneous amendments included : -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove restrictions on beef imports . -- Boosting the amount of U . S . grain which must be shipped each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to 800 , 000 tonnes from 500 , 000 tonnes now . -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to determine if it is a non - tariff trade barrier . -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the National Corn Growers Association up to 500 , 000 dlrs for the costs of defending the U . S . feedgrains program against a Canadian countervailing duty case this year . -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision to apply a duty on U .

92,"AWB CALLS FOR TIGHTER WHEAT QUALITY CONTROLS Australia is risking wheat export sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet buyer requirements , the Australian Wheat Board ( AWB ) said . "" Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly quality conscious , demanding strict adherence to contractual quality specifications ,"" the board said in a submission to the Royal Commission into Grain Storage , Handling and Transport . "" Many of the specifications are more specific than the current categories used in Australia ,"" it said . The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system . Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but lower - quality grades , the AWB submission said . It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every stage from receival to shipping . Better industrial relations at grain terminals , more uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock control were vital to improved marketing , it said . The submission also said Australia ' s federal system impeded the AWB ' s role of coordinating and managing the marketing of wheat . The AWB called for an end to physical and legislative constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient transport of grains to other states for shipment . "" It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode to the nearest efficient port , irrespective of the state in which the wheat is grown or stored ,"" it said . For example , wheat grown in northern New South Wales ( NSW ) might move more efficiently to Brisbane , in Queensland , than to Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales , it said . Similarly , southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or Geelong , in Victoria . Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over grain shipments was one notable impediment , it said . The AWB said the current approach of state - based bulk handling authorities is not essential , although it said it favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current level of control of storage and transport as long as quality was maintained . An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between 26 , 500 and 34 , 700 U . S . Dlrs to load a 50 , 000 - tonne vessel at various Australian ports compared with 21 , 200 dlrs at Houston and 16 , 300 at Port Cartier , Quebec , for a 60 , 000 - tonner ."

Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs , down from 61 pct some 20 years ago , official figures show . The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to improve productivity and demand / supply imbalances . The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly responsible for higher domestic prices , it said . The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has worsened working conditions among part - time farmers , the paper said . This could make it difficult to improve the industry ' s structure , the paper said . To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices to more reasonable levels , Japan should try to restructure the the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it self - supporting , it said ."

109,"PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTER Pakistan is not emerging as a major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough , Sartaj Aziz , Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the Pakistani Prime Minister , said in an interview . No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price , he said . Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable . The government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices , and the land would be better used for other crops . Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares . Some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds . The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 1 . 8 to 1 . 9 tonnes per ha to at least 2 . 5 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years , he said . Aziz said the current 1986 / 87 crop , harvesting of which is just beginning , is expected to yield around a record 14 . 5 mln tonnes . This compares with a target of 14 . 7 mln and last year ' s yield of 14 . 0 mln . He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly . The long - term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid - 1993 , taking into account Pakistan ' s annual population growth rate of more than three pct . Current consumption is some 12 . 5 mln tonnes . The current wheat reserve is 2 . 5 mln tonnes , Aziz said . This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes , which Pakistan will maintain at all costs , and a "" strategic reserve "" target of two mln tonnes . Despite the fact that stocks are a half - mln tonnes over target , the surplus will not be exported at present , he said . The government wants to keep an extra "" safety margin "" until it sees what effect the abolition of a 44 - year - old wheat rationing system will have on domestic consumption . New exports will be considered only in about a year ' s time when the 1987 / 88 crop can be gauged as well , he said . The new domestic policy , introduced on March 15 , is for the government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two rupees per kilo . With other costs this means a price in Pakistani markets of between 2 . 30 and 2 . 50 rupees per kilo . Under the old system , introduced during World War Two and due to be phased out by April 15 , some 50 mln ration cards were issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply . Aziz said following the introduction of a government support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the consumer , the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills . The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended , Aziz said . Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system . The wheat price in Karachi , the most expensive Pakistani city , had dropped from 3 . 11 rupees per kilo on March 1 to 2 . 85 rupees on March 30 . Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a major effect on total consumption , but it may encourage better use of side - products such as bran ."

111,"EC WHEAT RELEASE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY U . K . DEMAND The European Commission ' s decision to release an additional 300 , 000 tonnes of British intervention feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate relief in an increasingly tight market , traders said . Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage , pointing out that at this week ' s U . K . Intervention tender the market sought to buy 340 , 000 tonnes but only 126 , 000 tonnes were granted . The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to satisfy demand , they said , and keen buying competition for supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm . The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong representations by the U . K . Grain trade to the Commission . There has been growing concern that rising internal prices , triggered by heavy exports , were creating areas of shortage in interior markets . The latest EC authorisation will add 70 , 000 tonnes at the April 14 tender and a further 30 , 000 tonnes later in the month . The remaining 200 , 000 tonnes will be made available in May and June . News of the release produced an early downward reaction in local physical markets , but by midday some sections had halved early two stg losses while others were unchanged . Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1 . 85 mln tonnes of wheat and 1 . 74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the free market . However , some traders believe these figures are overstated and , while some may still be held on the farm , the bulk of wheat is already sold . Some of the grain is also off the market in futures stores . A total of 2 . 10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been sold for export or to the home market since the season started July 1 , leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1 . 59 mln tonnes . Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1 . 0 mln tonnes , leaving about 753 , 000 tonnes , traders said . This season ' s U . K . Export performance has surpassed all early expectations and has created the present nervous situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in August . The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total barley and wheat exports of around 10 . 5 mln tonnes , a new record and nearly double the previous record of 5 . 9 mln tonnes achieved in the 1984 / 85 season . Traders expect U . K . Wheat exports to reach 6 . 0 mln and barley around 4 . 50 mln tonnes . The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2 . 5 mln tonnes of British wheat and barley this season , but only 1 . 28 mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25 , traders said . Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British grain and for the July 1 / March 25 period had taken 2 . 59 mln tonnes of wheat and 2 . 06 mln tonnes of barley . This compares with 1 . 28 mln and 868 , 700 tonnes last season . The market is expecting prices , particularly wheat , to stay buoyant for the remaining few months of the season . If supplies become more difficult and prices strengthen further , feed compounders may increase cereal substitute usage , traders said ."
112,"SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter , weather and crop analysts said . Prospects for another near - record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point , but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems , analysts said . But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans , analysts of the Soviet Union said . "" From a weather standpoint , you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop ( than last year ),"" Gail Martell , chief meteorologist for E . F . Hutton said . The next six weeks in the USSR ' s grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops , Martell and other analysts said . "" Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us ,"" an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said . The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill . This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years , the USDA analyst said . With a timely spring , Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops , but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30 - 35 pct lower . Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures . This winter , however , snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent , so the bulk of winterkill , analysts speculate , likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination . "" Fall dryness may be a problem . There ' s a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness ,"" Martell said . Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine , and below normal over the entire winter crop area , she said . Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice - crusting and winterkill , Jim Candor , senior forecaster for Accu Weather , said . Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter , analysts said . The dry fall damaged pastures , the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off - pasture feeding , they said . "" The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they don ' t have to buy ( grains ) now ,"" a USDA official said . But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year ' s huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one - time fluke brought on by perfect conditions , more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies , he said . Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market , weather analysts said . "" A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half ,"" Martell said ."

119,"LOWER U . S . RICE STOCKS , STRONG EXPORTS - USDA Rising demand for U . S . rice may gradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help increase the U . S . share of the world rice market despite sluggish trade this year , the U . S . Agriculture Department said . In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary , the department said U . S . rice use may surpass production during the 1986 / 87 marketing year , causing stocks to fall about 10 mln hundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on July 31 . Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is expected to decline this year , the report said . USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain acreage have turned around . Domestic prices of medium grain relative to long grain have increased , the loan differential has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields relative to those of other classes have leveled off . With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the marketing loan , domestic rice use is expected to grow at a faster rate , USDA said . "" Development of new products and increased promotion have helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of consumers ,"" USDA said . USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because of large production and stocks but a weaker market should affect competing exporters more than the U . S . "" The United States has already recovered a substantial share of the European Community market and made inroads into markets in the Middle East and Africa ,"" the report said . World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels in 1986 / 87 , the report said , as higher per capita incomes , increased domestic production and low import prices have allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse grains . China , India and South Korea have increased output , while the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the mid - 1970s , the report said ."

128,"GAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH A study on grain certificates due out shortly from the Government Accounting Office ( GAO ) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays , administration and industry sources said . Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments , a GAO official told Reuters . GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen . Jesse Helms ( R - N . C .), former chairman of the senate agriculture committee . The report , which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash , is scheduled to be released in mid March . The cost of certificates , said the GAO source , depends on the program ' s impact on the USDA loan program . If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures , then the net cost of the program would go up . However , if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease , the cost effect of certificates would be less . GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded , the GAO official said . But a negative report on certificates "" will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program ,"" an agricultural consultant said .

129,"U . S . CORN , SORGHUM PAYMENTS 50 - 50 CASH / CERTS Eligible producers of 1986 crop U . S . corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates and 50 pct in cash , the U . S . Agriculture Department said . It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs . Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to the 4 . 3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm - Rudman budget deficit control act of 1985 , it said . Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency payments have already received about 2 . 8 billion dlrs and 225 mln dlrs , respectively , USDA said . The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51 . 5 cents per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were received by producers requesting advance payments . Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between an established target price and the higher of the basic loan rate , or the national average price received by farmers during the first five months of the marketing year -- September - January . National weighted average market prices for the first five months of the season were 1 . 46 dlrs per bushel for corn and 1 . 33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum . Eligible corn producers will be paid 63 cts per bushel , based on the difference between the 3 . 03 target price and the 2 . 40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate . Sorghum producers ' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents per bushel , based on the difference between the 2 . 88 dlrs per bushel target price and the 2 . 28 dlrs per bushel basic loan rate . The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the maximum permitted by law , the department said . Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another 1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates , the department said .

Grains , the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne . For example the recent large sales of wheat to China ( 1 . 5 mln tonnes ) and Egypt ( 2 . 0 mln tonnes ) were well below the breakeven export price , it said . Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price , GMP , calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years , the department said . In addition , deductions for taxes , freight , handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives . But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics , BAE , predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17 . 8 mln tonnes in 1986 / 87 to 13 . 5 mln in 1989 / 90 . The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U . S . wheat exports , the department said ."

139,"CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings , prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets . Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program . That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low . Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign - up for reduced acreage , but they have no price guarantees . With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal , traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans , even though the new crop soybean / corn ratio of 2 . 9 / 1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances . An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross - compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop , means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized , traders said . Here too , acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats , due to the more attractive deal from the government , they added . Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago , which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton . One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans , which are easier to grow , one commercial trader said ."

141,"EC SOURCES SAY UK WHEAT PLAN YET TO BE APPROVED The European Commission has not taken a decision on applications from the British government for the release of 200 , 000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the British market in May and June , Commission sources said .

It also indicated it planned to allow the release of another 30 , 000 tonnes from April 23 . However , it decided to leave consideration of the release of further wheat until later . The British government had applied for the release of a further 100 , 000 tonnes in both May and June from British intervention stores to prevent market prices rising . However , the sources said , the Commission wanted to review the market situation nearer the time before giving its approval . The Commission was given new powers last year to control the release of intervention cereals onto the market , the sources noted . Following last week ' s committee meeting , the U . K . Ministry of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made available in May and June . It also said that it was envisaged that monthly releases would be at least 100 , 000 tonnes , depending on the state of the market .

Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on the use of the certificates , Amstutz said that the issuance of 8 . 5 billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986 - 88 could result in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs . However , the use of certificates preclude the need for 450 to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs , resulting in net savings for the government of 50 - 100 mln dlrs , he said . Without the use of certificates , Amstutz said nearly the entire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have been forfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation , CCC . In addition , 260 mln bushels of grain that have been redeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges would have remained in the goverment inventory , he said . When asked to comment on a recent study by the General Accounting Office that concluded certificates result in a net cost to the government , Amstutz said , "" GAO underestimated the benefits and overstated the costs "" of the certificate program . Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loan entries , they also encourage heavier loan redemptions rather than forfeitures . GAO underestimated this net loan activity , Amstutz said . "" There is no question in the mind of the Department of Agriculture that these certificates have been very useful ,"" Amstutz said . Immediate benefits of certificates include greater market liquidity , improved market price competitiveness , higher farm income , and improved debt situation and decreased carrying costs , he said . Certificates are an integral part of USDA ' s long - range market - oriented farm policy , he said . Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep . Dan Glickman , D - Kans ., that USDA is in the process of preparing an official response to the GAO study on certificates and will submit it to the subcommittee when completed ."
143,"MORE U . S . GRAIN CERTIFICATES NEEDED , STUDY SAYS More generic grain certificates should be released onto the market in order for the U . S . certificate program to have its full effect on commodities , according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc . The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiency payments and paid land diversion payments in a two - third certificate , one - third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989 , Carroll Brunthaver , president of Sparks Commodities , told a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates . Thereafter , government payments should be issued in roughly a 50 - 50 split between cash and certificates , Brunthaver said . The Sparks study on certificates examined two possible scenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a "" zero certificate case ,"" where no certificate program was assumed , and an alternative case labeled "" adequate certificate case "" in which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings . The study showed that total grain use under the adequate certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario by 11 . 2 pct . Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990 , when grain usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct . For the five - year period examined , government expenditures under the adequate certificate case were 7 . 0 billion dlrs , or 7 . 5 pct less than under the zero certificate case . The Sparks study said that 5 . 1 billion dlrs , or 70 pct of those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs . The study also estimated that government grain stocks under the adequate certificate case would be 4 . 7 billion bushels below the zero certificate case at the end of the period examined . The Sparks study said that while certificates permit market prices to fall below loan levels , these lower prices increase commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus cash ."

157,"EC SOURCES DETAIL NEW FARM SOCIAL PACKAGE The 350 mln Ecu three - year package of social and structural measures agreed early today by European Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers for reducing output of certain surplus products , EC Commission sources said . The ministers agreed that under this "" extensification "" scheme , farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut output of specific products by at least 20 pct . The plan would initially apply to cereals , beef , veal and wine , they added . Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by reducing acreage , while cattle farmers would reduce their number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield . In each case , farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC . The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on the production they forego . The sources said the package also contains provisions for payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting or improving the environment . It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured farming areas would be extended to crops . At present such allowances are available only for livestock . The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into alternative farming techniques , the sources added . At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports for relatively poor farmers . Andriessen did not give full details , but said member state aid would be subject to "" strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition ."" EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus production . The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night proposals to pay "" early retirement "" pensions to farmers aged 55 or over who gave up production . Those who took their land completely out of farm production , rather than passing it on to their heirs , would have received more generous payments . Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme agreed ."

159,"TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST Torrential rains throughout Argentina ' s grain - producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday , trade sources said . Sunflower , maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected , they said . But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May . The rains did no damage to maize , sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year ' s harvest . Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires , with the heaviest rains in the province ' s western sectors , between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba , 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa , 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe , 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios , five and 40 mm in Misiones , and five and 50 mm in San Luis . No rain was recorded in Corrientes , Chaco and Formosa . Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week ' s estimates . Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe , though slowly . Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area , compared to five to seven pct last week . Total maize area planted for the 1986 / 87 harvest was estimated at between 3 . 58 and 3 . 78 mln hectares , or two to seven pct less than the 3 . 85 mln hectares planted in the 1985 / 86 harvest . Maize production is expected to total between 10 . 4 and 11 mln tonnes , or a drop of 17 . 5 to 19 . 4 pct over the 12 . 4 to 12 . 6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates , or 18 . 9 to 21 . 9 pct lower than last year ' s volume , according to official figures . The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area . Two to 2 . 2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest , down 29 . 9 to 36 . 3 pct from last year ' s figure of 3 . 14 mln hectares . Sunflower production is expected to total between 2 . 4 mln and 2 . 7 mln tonnes , which would mean a drop of between 34 . 1 and 41 . 5 pct against the record 4 . 1 mln tonnes harvested in the 1985 / 86 harvest . Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area , which this harvest is 1 . 23 to 1 . 30 mln hectares or 10 . 3 to 15 . 2 pct less than the 1 . 45 mln hectares planted in the 1985 / 86 harvest . Sorghum production is expected to total between 3 . 2 mln and 3 . 5 mln tonnes , or 16 . 7 to 22 pct less than the 4 . 1 to 4 . 2 million tonnes harvested in 1985 / 86 . Soybean production , by contrast , is expected to hit a record 8 . 0 to 8 . 4 mln tonnes , which would mean an increase of 11 . 1 to 15 . 1 pct over last year ' s record figure of 7 . 2 to 7 . 3 mln tonnes , according to private estimates . Official figures put last year ' s soybean harvest at 7 . 1 mln tonnes . Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition , helped by abundant rains and high temperatures . Total soybean - planted area for the 1986 / 87 harvest is expected to be a record 3 . 7 to 3 . 8 mln hectares , up 10 . 8 to 13 . 8 pct from last year ' s harvest figure of 3 . 34 mln hectares ."

Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that applying the so - called 0 / 92 provision to 1987 crops was supported by the Reagan administration and would save approximately 500 mln dlrs , including 266 mln dlrs in corn payments , 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton . The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House Agriculture Committee is approved by that body . Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U . S .

165,"CANADA WHEAT BOARD ADVISES CUT IN GRAIN PRICES The Canadian Wheat Board has advised the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to farmers for their wheat , oats , and barley in the crop year beginning August 1 , a board spokesman said . The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended price drops but said it would not be good news for western Canadian grain growers . "" They ' re all lower ,"" he said . "" This is really getting pretty serious . We ' re talking nuts and bolts economic survival and whether it ' s worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop ."" Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices . Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board . If the wheat board , which markets most of Canada ' s grain , obtains higher than expected prices on world markets , the farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year . If prices are lower , the federal treasury makes up the difference . The final decision on the initial prices , usually made in April , rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the federal cabinet . Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27 pct but last fall the government announced a one billion Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts .

"" We are in the market for grains , but it is up to the United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive prices ,"" he said in an interview . Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U . S . grain at prevailing market prices . "" We are being accused of not implementing this agreement . We do not consider we are at fault ,"" Melnikov said . Article I in the agreement states that "" purchases / sales of commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market price prevailing for these products at the time of purchase / sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms ."" "" The United States should supply to the Soviet Union definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the United States ready to supply this ?"" he said .

"" If the United States is interested in selling its wheat , then they must offer competitive prices , and it ' s up to the United States to decide how these competitive prices will be offered ,"" he said .

169,"U . S . WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT The U . S . Agriculture Department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program ( EEP ), senior USDA officials said . However , grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made , though not in the very near future . "" The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again ,"" an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said . "" But there just isn ' t much talk about it , informally or formally ."" Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets , even though U .

But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow , it could take several months . "" I just don ' t see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process ,"" the aide to Lyng said .

The agency said some areas of Guangxi , Hubei , Shanxi and other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than seven months . The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March , lowered the water level of many rivers , reduced hydroelectric power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and consumers . The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century , causing many ships to run aground and making harbour manoeuvres difficult , it said .

196,"INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW Indonesia "" s agriculture sector will grow by just 1 . 0 pct in calendar 1987 , against an estimated 2 . 4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines , the U . S . Embassy said in a report . Production of Indonesia "" s staple food , rice , is forecast to fall to around 26 . 3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26 . 58 mln tonnes in 1986 , according to the annual report on Indonesia "" s agricultural performance . The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26 . 7 mln tonnes , with a forecast 27 . 3 mln tonnes output in 1987 . The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1 . 5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1 . 69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks . "" Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane , rubber and copra show little or no gain ,"" the report says . "" The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans , palm oil and palm kernels ."" Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds , limited fertile land , insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops , the report underlines . The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as "" wereng "" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields . The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties , and to use lower - yielding , more resistant rice types . The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee , tea , rubber , plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices . Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7 . 0 pct in 1987 to 1 . 45 mln tonnes from 1 . 35 mln , with exports rising to an estimated 720 , 000 tonnes from 695 , 000 tonnes in 1986 , the report says . But while production of soybeans in 1987 / 88 ( Oct - Sept ) will rise to 1 . 075 mln tonnes from 980 , 000 in 1986 / 87 , imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant . The report says that imports of wheat , soybeans , soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September "" s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand . The report said that Indonesia "" s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate , the lowest rate of growth since the mid - 1960s . It compares with 1 . 9 pct growth in 1985 and 6 . 7 pct in 1984 . The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump ."
197,"HOUSE 0 / 92 FARM PROPOSAL SEEN SPARKING DEBATE A House Agriculture Committee meeting later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0 / 92 , or "" de - coupling ,"" provision to cover feedgrains , and those who oppose 0 / 92 or want it severely limited , Congressional sources said . The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one - year 0 / 92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter wheat crop . The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments . The administration has strongly urged that the bill be expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year . It is difficult to tell in what form the 0 / 92 provision will emerge from the committee , the sources said . Proponents of an expansion of 0 / 92 maintain there are large estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs . Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of the bill , committee staffers said . The 0 / 92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST . A conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting , and staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week . Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an expanded 0 / 92 program , since spring planting in many areas of the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30 . Farmers are now making their planting decisions , so something has to be done quickly if a 0 / 92 program is to be implemented , an Agriculture Department source said . An expansion of 0 / 92 to feedgrains was opposed in last week ' s subcommittee hearing on the bill , with subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman , D - Kan ., saying that more study of the consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was necessary . Major commodity groups , including the National Corn Growers , the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen ' s Association , have voiced strong opposition to 0 / 92 . But proponents of an expanded 0 / 92 argue that the bill currently is not equitable for all grains producers , so it should be extended to other crops . There will be difficulty in limiting 0 / 92 to wheat , said Gene Moos , aide to house majority leader Tom Foley , D - Wash . Projected cost savings , in the current atmosphere of try to decrease farm expenditures , would also be hard to ignore in the debate to expand the 0 / 92 application , Moos said . Rep . Charles Stenholm , D - Tex ., may be planning to introduce a bill to restrict 0 / 92 to only 1987 crop wheat , with the argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major changes in the farm bill . "" Stenholm ' s bill is not a rejection of 0 / 92 , only of the timing ,"" a congressional staff member said . Rep . Arland Stangeland ( R - Minn .) is reported to have an amendment to expand the 0 / 92 provision to 1987 and 1988 feedgrains ."

203,"HOUSE 0 / 92 PLAN SEEN SCALED - BACK TO 1987 WHEAT Key members of the House Agriculture committee have agreed to scale - back the 0 / 92 provision of a pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat , but a broader 0 / 92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later , Congressional sources said . The sources said key lawmakers including Reps . Glenn English ( D - Okla .), and Dan Glickman ( D - Kan .) agreed to support an amendment to be offered next week by Rep . Charles Stenholm ( D - Tex .) which would limit 0 / 92 only to producers of 1987 crop winter and spring wheat . This would scale - back the 0 / 92 provision to the original proposal by English allowing a pilot 0 / 92 program for 1987 wheat only . That provision was later broadened by the subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat . Under 0 / 92 , a farmer can forego planting a crop but still collect 92 pct of deficiency payments . Earlier today , the House Agriculture committee postponed until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill and 0 / 92 . The agreement to limit 0 / 92 to a wheat pilot program follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0 / 92 , and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill . Congressional sources said there has not been enough time to study the implications of a broad 0 / 92 . "" The timing ( of the proposal ) is off ,"" said one aide to a House Agriculture committee member . However , several Congressional sources said they expect a broader 0 / 92 provision to emerge again when the House Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part of an overall deficit reduction package . Gene Moos , aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley ( D - Wash .), predicted agriculture ' s share of budget cuts may exceed one billion dlrs . A broader 0 / 92 might be resurrected later because both the Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration estimate it would result in significant budget savings . A U . S . Agriculture Department official said 0 / 92 for all 1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1 . 5 billion dlrs over five years . Another factor which could affect the 0 / 92 debate is the approach of planting season , Congressional sources said . Some officials said it already is late for implementation of a 0 / 92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for wheat and feedgrains . If Congress approved 0 / 92 later in the year sign - up either would have to be extended or reopened , sources said ."

S . corn imports were injurious to Canadian growers and upheld a countervailing duty of 84 . 9 U . S . cts a bushel set earlier this year . The ruling is the result of trade action launched in 1985 by the Ontario Corn Producers Association that contended U .

It has been under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in December , 1985 . The proposed contract is based on 48 , 000 pound lots of 55 - pct high fructose corn syrup , the equivalent of one tank truck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet milling process .

218,"U . S . FEEDGRAIN 0 / 92 SUPPORTERS EVALUATE POSITION Advocates of a 0 / 92 plan for feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat , congressional sources said . The disaster aid bill , introduced by Rep . Glenn English ( D - Okla .), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to implement a 0 / 92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat . An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987 wheat , but supporters of a 0 / 92 feedgrains plan said even that scaled - down version would not be equitable for farmers . Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat , it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should be treated equally , they said . If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat , then supporters of a 0 / 92 feedgrains amendment will probably not offer their proposals next week , sources said . English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep . Charles Stenholm ( R - Tex ) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only , but whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear . Agricultural aides to English said the congressman ' s first choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat farmers . However , if the political reality is that disaster aid for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of controversy over spring wheat , then English might consider an even greater cutback in the bill , they said . Under a 0 / 92 plan , farmers could forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments . Rep . Arlan Stangeland ( R - Minn .) and Harold Volkmer ( D - Mo .) have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to include a 0 / 92 program for feedgrains . An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm bill , but to be fair to all crops . Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would likely sign up for 0 / 92 since the incentives to plant are greater than to idle the land , economists said . Opponents to a 0 / 92 feedgrains program argue it is premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the impacts of such a program ."
219,"U . S . CORN GROWERS BLAST CANADA CORN RULING Canada ' s ruling in favor of a duty on U . S . corn was a keen disappointment to the National Corn Growers Association and has set a dangerous precedent for other nations to follow , said Mike Hall , lobbyist for the association . "" The French corn growers will clearly charge ahead now and just change corn to corn gluten feed "" in their complaint , Hall told Reuters . A Canadian government agency ruled today that U . S . farm policies are causing injury to Canadian corn farrmers and supported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85 cts per bushel . "" This was cleary a political decision ,"" Hall said . "" The amount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant ."" The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrument that Canada bases its corn prices on U . S . futures prices and that American farm policy has driven down these prices , thus causing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger government payments through its farm stabilization program , Hall said . Hall said this is a new definition for injury , but that other nations might also now apply this same argument to attack U . S . farm programs . The French corn growers could now charge that U . S . farm programs create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed , Hall said . The French have long wanted to control the imports of U .

Another CBT official , executive vice president George Sladoje , said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a special meeting on the exchange floor . A number of presentations have been made with regard to renovating the financial futures room , Sladoje said . "" We ' ve looked at five or six different alternatives , involving such things as flip - flopping the trading rooms ,"" he added . It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans , we might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT markets , Sladoje said . "" If we move out of one floor entirely , then the construction period will be about a year ,"" he said , adding that the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then be on the drawing board for eight months to a year . The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were very preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until this summer at the earliest . In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits , exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary home next door in the present grains - dominated area . This could involve moving CBT markets in U . S . Treasury Bond futures , Treasury Notes , Muni - bonds , and options on T - Bonds and T - Notes through an adjoining corridor , while utilizing the MidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn , wheat , soybeans , soybean products and agricultural options . Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBT members . One senior floor trader said the financial futures room badly needs renovating . "" There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and the financials will move to the grains area ,"" he said . The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed was to renovate the financial floor in quadrants , one quarter at a time . "" The first step , after deciding the most effective way to proceed , would be to get architectural and engineering drawings ,"" he said . He added that it was difficult at present to determine an exact time frame for any possible moves . "" This is a major undertaking and a process that would spread out over next year ,"" he said . Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange , which merged with the CBT about a year ago , said they were preparing to vacate their floor at the end of this month . Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT by moving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reserved for lightly - traded CBT gold and silver futures , which now share their trading area . The MidAm specializes in mini - contracts in grains , livestock , metals , financials and foreign currencies as well as some options contracts . "" Rumor has it that the CBT grains are coming over here because the bonds are too crowded ,"" one MidAm trader said . Another source at the MidAm said this change could take place by July or August ."
245,"MARKET DISCOUNTS HIGHER SOVIET GRAIN IMPORTS Grain analysts said the increase of three mln tonnes in 1986 / 87 Soviet grain imports is unlikely to affect the market Tuesday . They said the market already has discounted higher Soviet imports , partly on news last month that the Soviet Union bought one mln tonnes of U . S . corn , and on rumors that the Reagan administration is pushing for authority to sell the Soviets U . S . wheat under the Export Enhancement Program . In its supply - demand report , the USDA raised its estimate for 1986 / 87 Soviet grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from 23 mln . "" That was business already done , for all practical purposes ,"" said Drexel Burnham analyst Dale Gustafson , reflecting similar statements made by other analysts ."
246,"USSR SEEN LIKELY TO HONOR CORN COMMITMENT The Soviet Union will likely honor its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four mln tonnes of corn this year , an Agriculture Department official said . "" They have always honoured the agreement , and there ' s no reason now to think they won ' t this year ,"" he told Reuters . "" They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European Community , from Canada , from the U . S . They ' re active buyers from all sources at this point ,"" the official said in explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes . This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U . S . corn for the first time in 15 years . A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina , concern over Soviet winter crops , and increasing competition for U . S . corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow ' s recent interest . Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan , and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation , the official said . "" The Soviets will try to out - capitalize the capitalists "" and buy corn before prices get too high , the official said . "" As soon as they need corn , they ' ll buy it ,"" he added . USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the Soviet Union , but both U . S . and Soviet analysts have said the purchases stand at 1 . 5 mln tonnes . The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets would enter the U . S . market again . "" There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from the situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of frenetic buying now ,"" the official said . However , the situation in wheat is "" a different story ,"" he said . Greater world supplies of wheat , heavier Soviet purchase commitments and less competitive U . S . wheat prices make Soviet purchases of U . S . wheat less likely , he said . Speculation has continued for several days that the U . S . is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets , but U . S . officials have provided no confirmation ."

Sichuan is one of six provinces threatened by drought . Wen Wei Po , a Hong Kong daily , said the drought , the worst for more than 20 years , is affecting nearly two mln hectares in 100 counties in Sichuan , the country ' s biggest agricultural producer . Sichuan has experienced temperatures three degrees Centigrade higher than normal and rainfall up to 70 pct less than normal since early February , affecting wheat , oil - bearing crops , rice planting and dryland cash crops , it said . The paper said 43 , 000 hectares in Meixian county in Guangdong are seriously short of water . The People ' s Daily said Henan , Shaanxi , Gansu and Hebei are also suffering from drought .

249,"DOLE SAYS 0 / 92 OPTION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED U . S . Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said Congress should consider legislation to apply the so - called 0 / 92 option to producers of major commodities . Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that he thought the proposal , supported by the Reagan administration , "" should be seriously considered "" because a refusal to do so could "" play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls "" placed on production . However , Dole did not say whether he would support the 0 / 92 option , which would offer producers at least 92 pct of their income support payments regardless of how much they planted . The Senate Republican leader said the 0 / 92 option posed two problems . First , it is viewed , he said , by some as welfare . In addition , debate on the proposal could open up the whole farm bill , Dole said . Dole also repeated his call for an across - the - board export enhancement program , saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union could help improve U . S . relations with that country . Dole said that the United States has made the decision to trade with Moscow and that it ' s important to offer competitive prices . The senator predicted Congress would have to decide this year whether to require an expansion of the export subsidy program , which currently targets benefits to recapture markets lost to other suppliers which subsidize . Dole , who last year pledged to offer legislation to require a marketing loan for major crops but never did so , again called for the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains . The Reagan administration ' s proposed farm policy changes "" are not going anywhere "" this year , Dole said , singling out the proposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year . Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed a shift in the State Department towards supporting an export enhancement initiative for the Soviet Union , Dole said he didn ' t see any change . Dole also said it would be a very close call in the Senate whether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year . Dole said he was encouraged by the selection of Republican David Karnes to replace the late Sen . Edward Zorinsky ( D - Neb .)"
250,"DOLE MULLS BILL TO EXTEND ETHANOL TAX EXEMPTION U . S .

Dole , addressing the National Corn Growers Association board , said the proposal was under consideration by a rural task force of Republican members of Congress and governors . Gasoline containing at least 10 pct ethanol now receives a six cents per gallon exemption from a nine cent federal excise tax . The exemption is to expire the end of 1992 . Ethanol is produced primarily by a few large agribusiness firms including Archer Daniels Midland ( ADM ) and A . E . Staley .

Agriculture Department ' s fourth conservation signup is expected to be announced tomorrow , and USDA officials said the figure may be higher than total enrollment for the first three signups . Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres , USDA conservation specialists said . Total enrollment so far in the 10 - year conservation program is 8 . 9 mln acres . Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres into the program , Milton Hertz , administrator for USDA ' s Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at a congressional hearing yesterday . Not all the bids will be accepted , Hertz said , but enrollment is expected to be high . As in the first three signups , the Great Plains area is expected to attract the greatest enrollment . "" The Great Plains area will be the predominate area which we ' ll get signup in ,"" a USDA conservation specialist said . Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of the acreage pulled from that area , he said . Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreage in the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production , but the USDA source said this would be a relatively small percent of the total . A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll part of their corn base acreage into the program has sparked more interest in this latest signup , USDA officials said .

258,"MORE HEAVY RAINS IN ARGENTINE GRAIN AREAS Heavy rains fell again in Argentina ' s main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday , trade sources said . Rains fell heaviest early in the week , and in particularly high volume in Buenos Aires province , Cordoba , La Pampa and Santa Fe provinces . Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires , heaviest in western sectors of the province , 20 to 145 mm in La Pampa , 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba , and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe . Rainfall was lighter in other provinces . Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes , five to 31 mm in San Luis , five to 30 mm in Entre Rios , three to 20 mm in Misiones , 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in Chaco . Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the rains had damaged crops , though they said maize and sunflower crops may have suffered . Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by the bad weather . For harvesting to resume as normal , the rains would have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow farm machinery to operate . The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern Buenos Aires , as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas there since February 23 while the annual average is 1 , 200 mm . Flooded areas total between 1 . 2 and 1 . 5 mln hectares , Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after flying over the flooded area . Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500 , 000 hectares of the area now flooded had been planted , and that 200 , 000 to 300 , 000 hectares could be lost . Growers said large parts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are low - lying and flood easily . Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the heavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of the damage . They said it was likely rain combined with high winds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants . The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south of Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated areas of northern Buenos Aires . Growers have harvested between 15 and 18 pct of total planted area , up from seven to nine pct a week ago . Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were revised downward in light of the bad weather . Estimates for total crop ranged from 2 . 3 to 2 . 6 mln tonnes , down from 2 . 4 to 2 . 7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down 34 . 1 to 41 . 5 pct from last year ' s record harvest of 4 . 1 mln tonnes . Maize harvesting also advanced , reaching between 13 and 15 pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week ago . The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10 . 2 mln tonnes , down from the 10 to 10 . 4 mln tonnes estimated a week ago . Last year ' s maize harvest totalled 12 . 8 mln tonnes , according to official figures . Soybean production estimates were revised downward , to 7 . 8 to 8 . 2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8 . 4 mln tonnes a week ago . Last year ' s soybean harvest totalled 7 . 1 mln tonnes , according to official figures . Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward , reaching between four and six pct of total planted area , compared to two to four pct a week ago .

He did not detail the commitments already made , but an AWB spokesman said they include sales to Egypt , China , Iran , the Soviet Union and Iraq . In the 1985 / 86 wheat year ended September 30 , the AWB exported a record 15 . 96 mln tonnes . Paice also said the 1986 / 87 Australian wheat harvest has ended after a long , cool summer with 15 . 14 mln tonnes delivered to the AWB . The season produced another good crop , with only 0 . 2 pct of receivals being downgraded to feed quality , he said . However , it is likely that some weather - damaged grain was still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986 / 87 , he said . Paice did not give a crop estimate , but the AWB ' s February Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 16 . 7 mln tonnes . But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could turn out to be too high , based on the receivals level , and the final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16 . 2 mln tonnes . The official estimate is not yet available . In the 1985 / 86 season , the AWB received 15 . 08 mln tonnes of the 16 . 13 mln tonne crop . Another 422 , 000 tonnes was retained on - farm and 620 , 000 sold under the permit system introduced in 1984 / 85 to allow farmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWB ' s receival system , according to Bureau of Agricultural Economics data ."

Under the terms of Portugal ' s January 1986 accession to the European Community , EC , a grain import monopoly held by EPAC ( Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais ) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990 . Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first liberalised 20 pct share of the country ' s annual import needs . The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders . Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon ' s civil court , in a preliminary ruling , had decided EPAC should not be allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders . Trade sources said the ruling , though effective immediately , was subject to appeal and would have to be confirmed in further proceedings . A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said that , as a result of the court ' s decision , the Commission would not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being held today for the import of 80 , 000 tonnes of corn . Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC ' s participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of Portugal ' s EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency ' s import monopoly . It also said the participation of EPAC , which still controls the national grain storage and distribution network , was unfair competition to the private traders . Traders said they believed the EC ' s Executive Commission was unlikely to get involved in the dispute , preferring to leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue .

"" We have a budget driven farm policy . It may be a shame , but we are locked into this ,"" said Dan Glickman , ( D - Kans .), chairman of the subcommittee on wheat , soybeans and feed grains . "" We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer . A 0 / 92 plan , if properly done , could do both ."" Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0 / 92 bill for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains . An aide to Glickman said that it will probably be introduced next week . Glickman said a 0 / 92 program , which allows a farmer to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency payment , would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill -- only an extension of the 50 / 92 option already provided under the current bill . It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill , he said , but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet budget goals , a voluntary 0 / 92 plan would be better than sharply cutting target prices , as USDA has proposed . A 0 / 92 plan , however , would not be decoupling , but simply a different type of acreage diversion program , Glickman said . Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this point , he said . "" I don ' t think there is any interest in pursuing a decoupling bill this year . Period . Unequivocal ,"" Glickman said at the hearing . Sen . Rudy Boschwitz ( R - Minn .), cosponsor of the Boren / Boschwitz decoupling plan , said he supports a short term 0 / 92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan . Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0 / 92 plan in the senate . His plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to participating farmers , require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only , prohibit haying and grazing on extra idled acreage , limit participation to a certain number of acres in a county and provide tenant protection provisions . "" I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987 , but we can at least move in that direction ,"" Boschwitz said . Robbin Johnson , vice president of Cargill , Inc ., testified in favor of decoupling . Decoupling would end the current bias in U . S . farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers ' dependency on the government , he said . A 0 / 92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling , Johnson said , and would still encourage farmers to plant . Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and the National Cattlemen ' s Association said their groups oppose any 0 / 92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers . But when asked if his association were forced to choose between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0 / 92 program , Larry Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0 / 92 rather than take sharp cuts in target levels ."
276,"CARGILL OFFICIAL DEFENDS CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS The use of generic in - kind commodity certificates has helped ease storage problems and is a necessary part of export promotion programs , a senior executive for the world ' s largest grain company said . Testifying before the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat , soybeans and feedgrains , Robbin Johnson , vice president of Cargill , Inc ., disputed claims that U . S . grain companies have made huge profits from certificate trading . "" The certs program is not in any way a windfall to the trade ,"" he said . Johnson said that Cargill has been dealing with a two pct spread in certificate transactions , and that this is within the normal grain marketing levels . Johnson recognized current concern over the cost of certificates as compared to cash , but said that critics need to look more closely at the savings caused by certs , noting for example that widespread use of certs in the PIK and Roll marketing technique last summer helped ease storage costs . Certificates are also an important part of any export promotion program , he said . "" The more you look at ways to expand export markets , the more you have to look at ways to expand certs to put more grain into the market to meet demand ,"" he said . Subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman ( D - Kans .) said his committee would be looking at the certificate program later this year and studying the General Accounting Office report on certificate costs ."
277,"U . S . MARKET LOAN NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE - BOSCHWITZ A marketing loan for U .

"" I think I would not support a marketing loan now ,"" he told the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat , soybeans and feedgrains . Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a marketing loan for cotton and rice , but has since focused support on decoupling legislation , the Boren / Boschwitiz bill . A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage more production , especially in high - yielding areas , would be much more expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loans and not increase exports significantly , he said ."

Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is only 8 . 9 mln acres , so the sharp increase expected this year has underpinned new crop corn futures all week .

REPORT The Soviet Union has been a heavy buyer of Yugoslav corn since October , purchasing close to 1 . 5 mln tonnes in the 1986 / 87 marketing year , according to a report from the U . S . agriculture counselor in Belgrade . Approximately 1 . 5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already been committed to foreign buyers for 1986 / 87 , with most of this sold to the Soviet Union , the Yugoslav Grain Association reported to the U . S . official . In a report dated March 10 , the official said that about 800 , 000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered , with the balance of 700 , 000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June . An additional 500 , 000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from July - September , the grain associaiton said , so total Yugoslav corn exports could reach 2 . 0 mln tonnes , the counselor said . Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for exporting corn to the Soviet Union , the counselor said . Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged around 160 , 000 tonnes since October 1 , higher than earlier estimates of 150 , 000 , the official said . The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslav corn sales during this marketing year , he said ."
288,"NUMEROUS FACTORS SAID POINT TO USSR CORN BUYING A greater than anticipated need , competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking Soviet interest in U . S . corn , industry and government officials said . As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the Soviet Union has purchased an additional 1 . 5 mln tonnes of U . S . corn , industry and government sources noted a number of factors that make Soviet buying of U . S . corn likely . First , there are supply concerns . Some trade sources said recent speculation has been that last year ' s Soviet grain crop be revised to only 190 mln tonnes , rather than the 210 mln announced , therby increasing the Soviet need for grain . A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect Soviet corn buying , an Agriculture Department source said . Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to the USSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its Argentine 1986 / 87 corn crop estimate this week to 11 . 0 mln tonnes , down from 11 . 5 mln . Argentina corn exports were also cut by 500 , 000 tonnes to 6 . 8 mln tonnes . Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this year ' s corn for export , a USDA official said , with two mln tonnes of that booked for April - June delivery to the USSR . "" Significant downside potential "" still exists for the Argentine crop , the official said , which will decrease the amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow . "" If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been thinking , then they might need more than what Argentina can provide during the April to June period ,"" he said . Current competitive prices for U . S . corn have also sparked Soviet buying . U . S . corn was reported to be selling on the world market earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne , Argentine corn for 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread , U . S . and Soviet sources said . "" This price difference makes American corn competitive ,"" Albert Melnikov , commercial counselor for the Soviet Union , told Reuters . Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause those prices to rise , and with the recently strong U . S . corn futures prices , the Soviets might feel corn prices have bottomed and that this is a good time to buy , sources said . Finally , some industry sources said that by buying the minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U . S ./ USSR grains agreement ( four mln tonnes ), the Soviet Union may be hoping to convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat . In an inteview with Reuters this week , USDA secretary Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat subsidy offer , but that such an offer had not been ruled out ."

295,"U . S . CONSERVATION FIGURES SEEN NEUTRAL / BEARISH U . S . Agriculture Department ( USDA ) figures for highly - erodible land enrolled into the Conservation Reserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral to bearish , although some said a full state - by - state breakdown would be needed to assess the full price impact . "" Out of 10 . 5 mln acres only 1 . 9 mln acres were accepted in corn -- That ' s neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the trade was looking for ,"" Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert said . The USDA said it had accepted 10 , 572 , 402 more acres into the conservation program out of bids on a total of 11 , 254 , 837 acres . Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures , but some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates slightly . The USDA is due to release planting intentions figures March 31 . Indications of a heavy sign - up in the conservation program recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage to 63 . 0 to 67 . 0 mln acres from 67 . 0 to 69 . 0 mln . Richard Loewy , analyst with Prudential Bache Securities , said there was not enough information to completely assess the conservation figures . "" The 1 . 9 mln acres on corn is certainly disappointing ,"" he added . The USDA later released the state - by - state breakdown of the enrollment figures . Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for both new crop corn and soybeans , and might possibly mean an upward adjustment in planting intention figures . Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates onto the market this spring , he said : "" The trade was definitely looking higher , so certificates are going to be less than expected ."" The USDA offered a special corn "" bonus "" rental payment to the farmers to be paid in generic certificates . The bonus amounts to two dlrs per bushel , based on the farm program payment yield for corn , for each acre of corn accepted into the reserve . Katharina Zimmer , analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures , said the conservation sign - up was slightly higher than she had expected , although she noted that some trade expectations were considerably higher than the actual figures . "" I think it is friendly for the market , at least in the long run ,"" she said . Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some confusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure between 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign - up or the latest addition . "" It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid into the program ,"" she said . Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas about corn planting figures as a result of the conservation sign - up . She added that while some trade guesses were as low as 61 mln acres , she was looking for corn plantings to be in the high 60 ' s . Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to around 64 mln acres . New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign - up in the program , despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor yielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to final production figures ."

President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December , in line with IMF recommendations , but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots . The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances . The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government ' s current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia ' s foreign exchange auction . The central bank ' s weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January , pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate . The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction , losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months , but since the end of January has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar .

The savings resulting from the additional 3 . 5 mln acres idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings , 35 mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings , and 10 - 20 mln dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings , the report said . The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0 / 92 acreage program for wheat , corn , cotton , sorghum and barley . Last year , almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested . "" The likelihood that the 0 - 92 provisiion will cause very large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite small ,"" the report said . "" The returns on typical farms still favor participation in the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted acreage ,"" the USDA report said .

"" In the heart of the corn belt , you would not get that much participation ,"" Collins said . USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 0 / 92 , 1 . 5 mln acres of corn , 500 , 000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500 , 000 acres of cotton . Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat , 180 mln bushels of corn , 20 mln bushels of sorghum , 10 mln bushels of barley , and 500 , 000 bales of cotton , the report said . "" In determining whether to participate , a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered ,"" according to the analysis . "" What you ' re giving up under 0 / 92 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production ,"" Collins said . For producers with low production costs , that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs , he said . Under these cicumstances , farmers would not want to go along with 0 / 92 . But for high cost producers , 0 / 92 would be more attractive . Also , as loan rates get lower , Collins said there would be more incentives to participate in a 0 / 92 program . "" I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first , but it is a step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments ,"" Collins said . In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and Feed Association , USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too late to implement 0 / 92 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month ."

315,"CHINA TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 1987 China ' s grain imports will rise in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand , but will be not be as large as in the past , Chinese officials and Japanese traders told Reuters . They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy would not allow a return to large - scale imports , which peaked at 16 . 15 mln tonnes in 1982 . An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year , against 7 . 73 mln in 1986 and 5 . 97 mln in 1985 . Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor harvest and rising domestic demand , but remained below exports , which rose to 9 . 42 mln tonnes from 9 . 33 mln in 1985 . "" China is short of foreign exchange ,"" the Shanghai official said . "" We cannot rely on imports , even at current low world prices . Only if there is a major disaster will we become a major importer ."" A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought , low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and animal consumption . "" At current prices , China loses yuan on every tonne of grain it exports , though it earns foreign exchange which it badly needs ,"" the trader said . The People ' s Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is affecting 13 . 3 mln hectares of arable land , which will reduce the summer grain harvest from last year ' s level . The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying enough attention to agriculture , especially grain , making it difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln tonnes against 391 mln in 1986 . "" All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest area , especially of corn , sweet potatoes , paddy rice and high - yield cash crops ,"" it said . It added factory production might have to be reduced to provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight the drought . Since January , the press has devoted much attention to grain , stressing that growth in output is vital to China ' s economic and political stability and that prices paid to farmers are too low . Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain production is a key state policy and outlined the measures being taken in their areas to encourage output . The Shanghai official said that in one suburb , 10 pct of the pre - tax profits of factories are used to subsidise agriculture . He said rural industries in other suburbs also set aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the 70 , 000 workers available to help farmers . Chu Jinfeng , an official of Fengbing county outside Shanghai , said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits . Pan Huashan , an official of the agricultural department of Zhejiang Province , said rural industry also subsidises grain output in his province . "" In addition , we are setting up grain production bases , raising the level of science and technology on the farms and improving the supply of raw materials , roads and other infrastructure ,"" he said . The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their spare time , or let other family members farm it . In some cases , they lease the land to grain farmers . The China Daily said last month that grain output should reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480 and 500 mln by 2000 . It said growing grain should be made profitable . "" The advantages the state promises grain growers actually yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption . Only this will boost enthusiasm ,"" it said ."

About 60 pct of the maize will be delivered by large - scale commercial farmers and the balance by small - scale peasant producers . Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries since 1980 , the sources said there is no danger of a food shortage in Zimbabwe . While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750 , 000 tonnes , the GMB stockpile is currently around 1 . 8 mln tonnes , which means that even with the sharply reduced production this year Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years . The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a 25 pct increase in cotton production to 315 , 000 tonnes from 248 , 000 tonnes last year , and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean deliveries to 100 , 000 tonnes from 84 , 000 tonnes in 1986 ."

328,"U . S . HOUSE APPROVES PILOT 0 / 92 DISASTER PROGRAM The House of Representatives approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant . The one - time pilot 0 / 92 program , designed to assist farmers in Kansas , Oklahoma , Michigan and parts of Missouri , was passed by a 304 - 100 vote and sent to the Senate . Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0 / 92 provision endorsed by the Reagan administration , the U . S . Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure . USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administration ' s proposed broad - scale revision of farm programs . The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received . To be eligible , winter wheat farmers could not plant a different crop on that land this spring , although they could use the land for grazing or to plant hay . USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs , largely because of reduced crop forfeitures . The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last fall ' s flooding . In addition , the measure would require USDA to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by Congress last fall . Currently , because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs in appropriated funds , USDA plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses . The administration said it opposed the bill because , by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief , it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance . USDA also said the 0 / 92 provisions in the bill were narrower than the administration ' s proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings . USDA said the 0 / 92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs , while the requirement to compensate fully disaster - struck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs , which must be appropriated by Congress . The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs . USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln dlrs . In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987 winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments . But the Senate bill would not offer the 0 / 92 option to wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400 - mln dlr ceiling on the disaster assistance program ."

332,"U . S . CERTIFICATES TO PROVIDE WHEAT / CORN SUPPLIES From April through December 1986 , the Commodity Credit Corporation ( CCC ) issued 3 . 85 billion dlrs worth of generic certificates and about 1 . 8 billion had not been exchanged by January 1 , 1987 , the U . S . Agriculture Department said . The department said an additional 4 . 3 billion dlrs in certificates has been authorized for issuance during January - August , 1987 . These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn and wheat for the remainder of the crop year , the department said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report . Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U . S . grain more competitive on world markets , it said . The department said last summer , for example , certificates were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn . This helped increase marketable supplies , so farm - level corn prices averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they would have otherwise . The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40 to 50 mln bushels , it said . The department said government spending on farm programs in fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from 1986 ' s 25 . 8 billion dlrs . During 1988 and 1989 , the cost escalation of the first half of the 1980 ' s will reverse . If current policy remains in force , annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last year ' s record by more than eight billion dlrs , it said . The department said the President ' s budget proposals for 1988 - 1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24 billion dlrs . In 1987 , foreign economic growth is expected to remain close to 2 . 6 pct , the same as in 1986 , but above the 2 . 4 pct average of 1980 - 86 , it said . Partially because of this improvement , U .

While the department has not made any final decision , banning the use of pik and roll grain in reserve rotation is under heavy consideration , he said . Changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for next year ' s crop , he said , with the option of making soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates under consideration . VanGarlem said he will definitely not extend the 1987 crop program signup , saying he sees no reason to do so at this time . He also said wheat will not be considered for a cash bonus under the Conservation Reserve Program ."

336,"CONGRESSMAN URGES WHEAT EEP TO SOVIET UNION Kansas Republican Congressman Pat Roberts urged the Reagan administration to offer export enhancement program , eep , subsidies to the Soviet Union . Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee , Roberts said the U . S . has offered eep to China and Poland , and should also include the Soviet Union . Rep . Roberts said there had been some talk that the issue of an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reagan administration recently because Secretary of State George Shultz was out of the country . "" That very well may be the case ,"" said Tom Kay , U . S . Agriculture Department Foreign Agricultural Service administrator . However , Kay told Reuters later that his reply to Roberts was not based on any particular knowledge . Rep . Roberts urged Kay to convey to top officials of the USDA that some in Congress favor a wheat eep to Moscow . "" I ' d be delighted to deliver the message ,"" Kay replied . Earlier , Kay had repeated Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng ' s statement last week that "" the door is not yet closed on an eep to the Soviet Union ."""

Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng told representatives of several of the largest grain exporting firms and two farm organizations that he was not in a position to comment on their request that the Reagan administration offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union , according to participants in today ' s meeting . "" He ( Lyng ) simply told us he was not in any position to talk about an EEP ( export enhancement program ) initiative to the Soviet Union ,"" said Glen Hofer , vice president of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives .

Participants in the meeting included Cargill Inc , Continental Grain Co , Louis Dreyfus Corp , Union Equity Cooperative Exchange , the National Association of Wheat Growers , the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives , among others , participants said . Deputy Agriculture Secretary Peter Myers and Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz also attended the 30 - minute meeting . Hofer described Lyng as "" sympathetic but noncommittal ,"" and said he thought he detected "" a sense of frustration "" on Lyng ' s part at not being able to respond more positively to the group ' s urging . A grain industry representative said some participants were "" puzzled "" by USDA ' s apparent reluctance to bring before the cabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets . "" There is a feeling that there is more receptivity ( to the idea ) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been ,"" this official , who asked not to be identified , said , referring to an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets . This official said there was not a significant amount of pressure being exerted by lawmakers on Lyng to make an EEP offer to Moscow . Reminded that Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt .) had written two letters to Lyng urging such an offer , this official said Lyng had received virtually no phone calls from lawmakers on the subject .

341,"U . S . CORN MARKET SKEWED BY SOVIET BUYING Recent purchases of U . S . corn by the Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf export point and interior levels , cash grain dealers said . Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which a dealer in Davenport , Iowa , said was roughly 20 pct wider than normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by making it worthwhile for farmers to move grain . By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn , the USDA could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales , where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed . If the USDA acts soon , as many dealers expect , the movement would break the Gulf corn basis . "" The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county posted prices ,"" one dealer said . "" It should be taking the average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City ,"" which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior Midwest . "" But we don ' t know when they might do it ,"" an Ohio dealer said , which has created uncertainty in the market . The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to the government and remain off the market and in storage . Yesterday , USDA issued a report showing that only slightly more than 50 pct of the 3 . 85 billion dlrs in PIK certificates it has issued to farmers ( in lieu of cash payments ) had to date been exchanged for grain . With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months , the USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain by adjusting the ASCS prices , cash grain dealers said . A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest to the export terminals , cash dealers said . Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the original tariff price . The mild winter and early reopening of the mid - Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the firmer trend in barge freight , dealers noted . The higher transportation costs have served to depress interior corn basis levels , squeezing the margins obtained by the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as discouraging farmer marketings , they said . "" The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports ,"" which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much as 4 . 0 mln tonnes of U . S . corn , one Midwest cash grain trader said . But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside , freight rates will settle back down because of the overall surplus of barges on the Midwest river system ."

343,"HOUSE FARM LEADER SEES BILLION DLR BUDGET CUTS The 1988 agriculture budget will have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs , the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said . Implementation of a 0 / 92 program , a tightening up of the use of commodity certificates , and reconstitution of farms are possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending , said Dan Glickman , D - Kans ., chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat , soybeans and feedgrains . Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and Feed Association , Glickman said he learned this week from the House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved . Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988 budget , Glickman added . Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA ' s proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year . "" The administration ' s target price proposals are dead in the water ,"" he said . To cut the budget , Glickman said , "" everthing is on the table ,"" except those moves that would reduce farmers ' income . Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee will study in order to cut farm spending . Implementation of a 0 / 92 program for 1987 winter wheat and 1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman , which he said would result in a 150 - 200 mln dlr savings for one year . Tightening up on the use of generic ( in - kind , or "" pik ') certificates will also be another option his committee will study , Glickman said . While not committing himself for or against such action , he said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which indicate certificates cost more than cash payments . Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and tightening up of the person definition for annual payment limitations is another option and could save 100 - 200 mln dlrs . He also said increasing acreage set - aside requirements by five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign - up was a move that could save about one billion dlrs , but added that he would not be in favor of such a change . Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program ' s , EEP , spending authority of 1 . 5 billion dlrs is quickly being used up , and Congress will have to decide whether to expand this program while making cuts in other areas . Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely , he said . "" I don ' t see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping block ,"" Glickman said ."

348,"ARGENTINE MAIZE , SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL Argentine grain growers reduced their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current harvest in the week to yesterday , trade sources said . Soybean production for 1986 / 87 is now estimated to reach between 7 . 7 and eight mln tonnes , versus 7 . 8 to 8 . 2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago and eight to 8 . 4 mln tonnes estimated in mid - February . But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8 . 5 to 12 . 7 pct greater than last year ' s total of 7 . 1 mln tonnes , according to official figures , and would be a new record . The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a record 3 . 7 to 3 . 8 mln hectares and increased 10 . 8 to 13 . 8 pct compared to the 3 . 3 mln hectares planted last year . The change in yield estimates is due to very high temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in the soybean - producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires province . The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean pods empty , especially in Cordoba . Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops , since rainfall was slight in most main soybean - producing areas . Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in Buenos Aires province , totalling between one and 10 mm . There was no recorded rain in other grain - producing provinces . With clear skies and seasonable temperatures , fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks , allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize , sunflower and sorghum harvesting . Crops were considered in generally good condition , though it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of recent weeks caused any long - term damage . The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the total area planted , compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago . Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at 3 . 58 to 3 . 78 mln hectares , down two to seven pct from the 3 . 85 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest . Total production for the current maize harvest is expected to reach between 9 . 9 and 10 . 1 mln tonnes , versus 10 to 10 . 2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago . The new figure is 21 . 1 to 22 . 7 pct lower than the 12 . 8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest , according to official figures . The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of total planted area , versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago . Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two to 2 . 2 mln hectares , or 29 . 9 to 36 . 3 pct lower than the record 3 . 14 mln hectares planted in the 1985 / 86 harvest . The current harvest ' s volume was again expected to be between 2 . 3 and 2 . 6 mln tonnes , or 34 . 1 to 41 . 5 pct lower than last harvest ' s record 4 . 1 mln tonnes . Yields varied widely from area to area , and growers feared that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on crops and , consequently , on total production volume . The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of total planted area , compared to four to six pct a week ago . Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1 . 2 and 1 . 3 mln hectares , or 10 . 3 to 15 . 2 pct lower than the 1 . 4 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest . Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest remained at 3 . 2 to 3 . 5 mln tonnes again this week , or 16 . 7 to 22 pct lower than last harvest ' s total volume of 4 . 1 to 4 . 2 mln tonnes ."

356,"OECD FARM SUBSIDIES STUDY RESULTS DETAILED The results of a controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris - based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development , OECD , show Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world , and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies . Results of the study , which has not been released by OECD because of objections from some countries , were provided to Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified . The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 1979 - 81 using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent , PSE . The study shows that on dairy products Japan ' s PSE , or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage , averaged 83 . 3 pct over 1979 - 81 , with the European Community at 68 . 8 pct and the United States 48 . 2 pct . For wheat Japan ' s PSE averaged 95 . 8 pct , the EC 28 . 1 and the U . S . 17 . 2 . Japan ' s rice PSE was 68 . 8 pct compared to the EC 13 . 6 and the U . S . 5 . 4 pct , the OECD calculations show . In coarse grains , Japan ' s subsidies reached 107 . 1 pct compared with 27 . 9 pct for the EC and 13 . 1 pct for the U . S . Japan ' s beef subsidy was 54 . 9 pct versus 52 . 7 pct for the EC and 9 . 5 pct for the U . S ., OECD concluded . For sugar , Japan ' s PSE was 48 . 4 pct versus 27 . 9 pct in the EC and 13 . 1 pct for the U . S ., the study shows . The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as Canada , Australia and New Zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the U . S ., EC and Japan , the sources said . Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil , two major developing country producers of commodities , were not included in the OECD work . Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon , perhaps coinciding with the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris during May . Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in Geneva . British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture . He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels , which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture . However , the OECD study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers , officials familiar with the study said . The U . S . Agriculture Department ' s Economic Research Service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD results and update them to 1982 - 84 . In some cases the results were substantially different than the OECD ' s , in part because farm policies in both the U . S . and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982 - 84 from the OECD base period of 1979 - 81 , U . S . officials said . For example , the USDA study found the United States subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982 - 84 , at 25 to 49 pct , than in the EC , at zero to nine pct . French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale , citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn , told reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its farmers more than the EC . However , the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably higher than the U . S . now because of increases since 1984 . Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels , a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation . The updated calculations , which may take several months to complete , are expected to show substantial increases in U . S . subsidy levels for sugar because the U . S . imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry . U . S . subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill , which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice , officials added ."
357,"SOVIET TIMECHARTERING BOOSTS GRAIN FREIGHT RATES Current interest by Soviet charterers in taking Panamax vessels on timecharter , mainly from the U . S . To carry grain , is seen as the chief factor behind the recent surge in values on the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange ( BIFFEX ), dealers said . Futures soared through the 1 , 000 points barrier today for the first time in the spot position since the market opened in May 1985 . However , the market tends to be nervous , with values some 100 points above the Baltic Freight Index , which is calculated on spot physical rates . No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings but they have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage ( about 50 , 000 to 65 , 000 tonnes dw ) from the U . S . Gulf which would normally operate on the trip to Japan , dealers said . "" It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effect on its ( the Soviet ) grain harvest than reported ,"" one said . Freight rates on the Gulf / Japan grain route have subsequently been the main beneficiary of current chartering conditions , with very few , if any , Panamax sized ships left for the remainder of this month in the Gulf . Rates have risen steadily for vessels loading next month . Dealers said there is even talk that owners are considering taking older vessels out of lay - up to meet current demand . Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chinese operators may be in the market for similar timecharter business later in the year , they said . They anticipate this would appear around June and it has prompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract , despite it normally being a slack time in the shipping year . Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks . Rates turned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices , which had supported the market at the start of the year , faltered but then recovered on the reported Soviet interest ."
358,"USDA ASKS TIGHT INSECT RULES FOR GRAIN SHIPMENTS The U . S . Agriculture Department is proposing tighter federal standards setting allowable limits on insect infestations in grain shipments .

In response to a query on what the State Department ' s position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow , Shultz told the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that prices must be competitive if the U . S . is going to trade . The Soviet Union , the world ' s largest grain importer , has bought no U . S . wheat for more than a year , complaining the price was far above world market levels . A U . S . offer last fall to sell the Soviets lower - priced wheat through the export enhancement program , EEP , was also rebuffed due to the price . Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U . S . wheat offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet Union , grain industry sources said . Intense speculation the U . S . might make a fresh EEP wheat offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in recent trading sessions . Kansas City hard wheat futures rose another 2 - 1 / 4 cents by midday at 2 . 88 - 1 / 4 dlrs per bushel , while CBT March wheat was up 1 - 1 / 2 cents at 2 . 92 - 1 / 2 dlrs . "" I ' m not sure this is an about - face , but it ' s clearly a recognition that unless we ' re competitive , we won ' t sell to the Soviet Union ,"" said a lobbyst for a major commodity group . "" We have to be competitive . It ' s ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else ,"" Shultz told the farm leaders . "" That is our approach in negotiations with the Soviets ,"" he said . If those comments do signal that the State Department is no longer opposed to the U . S . selling wheat to the USSR under EEP , it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to Moscow , an industry lobbyst said . National Wheat Grower ' s officials were taking a cautious attitude towards the secretary ' s comments . "" His comments were not discouraging , but they didn ' t in our judgment promise any immediate action on EEP ,"" an official with the wheat group said . The Wheat Growers official noted , however , that "" there is significance in that fact that we haven ' t seen any significant negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets ."" In a meeting with exporters this week , Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow , the officials said . An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz , who is reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets , said that the Shultz comments "" are consistent with what he ( Shultz ) has taught for years as an economist ,"" but said they don ' t necessarily relate to the Soviet Union . Amstutz could not be reached for comment , and an aide to Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz ' s statements . But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow . "" If he didn ' t say no , then there ' s a chance . This is potentially a positive development ,"" a commodity source said ."
363,"EC TO ABOLISH TAX ON SPANISH MAIZE EXPORTS The European Community Commission has decided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonne imposed on exports of Spanish maize , Commission sources said . They said the tax , which applies to Spanish sales to EC and non - EC countries alike , would no longer be required on exports from Spanish ports south of Valencia . The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority ' s cereals management committee today . The tax had been introduced last September at the same time as a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exports of maize to Spain from other EC member countries . The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported into Spain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies from being reexported back to them . The sources added that Spain had received no answer from the committee to its request that tenders be opened for the sale to third countries of 450 , 000 tonnes of maize . The request will be considered at the committee ' s next meeting , the commission sources said . Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1 . 7 mln tonnes of maize this year , while an EC - U . S . accord guarantees non - EC producer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300 , 000 tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years ."

368,"U . S . WHEAT GROUPS CALL FOR GLOBAL ACTION All major grain producing countries must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed , two U . S . wheat organizations said . The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions , "" but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions "" on world grain trade , the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers , NAWG , and the chairman of U . S . Wheat Associates said in a letter to U . S . Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter . Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of government - run export trading entities , a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved , and a recognition that supply reductions by the U . S . have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be , the two organizations said While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments . Australia ' s proposals , which aim to reduce U . S . target prices and "" quarantine "" U . S . wheat stocks , would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U . S . farmers , they said . Other countries , including Australia , have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U . S . acreage and crop reduction programs , the organizations said . "" We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers ,"" Jim Miller , president of NAWG said . "" We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the world ' s major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture ,"" Miller said ."
369,"SHULTZ NOT OPPOSED TO WHEAT SUBSIDY TO SOVIETS Secretary of State George Shultz has decided not to oppose any U . S . wheat subsidy offer to the Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the Agriculture Department , a State Department official said . "" Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy last summer , and he ' s not going to the mat again . It ' s now basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what they want to do ,"" the official said . If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union , he said , "" Shultz will not wage a vigorous campaign against it . He might not come out in favor of it , but he won ' t go to the President and voice his objections ."" In an official statement clarifying Shultz ' s remarks yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers , the State Department said , "" Secretary Shultz expressed his belief that whenever possible , U . S . grain should be competitive on world markets , including the Soviet Union . The Agriculture Department is in the best position to determine whether consideration should be given at this time to extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement Program ."" Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the Soviets , there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to Moscow , the State Department official said . "" Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a subsidy to be offered , we would not offer it unless we had a firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy ."" USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized wheat , the official , who asked not to be identified , said . The Soviets rejected the U . S . offer then on the grounds that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring U . S . prices down to competitive levels . The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time , the State Department source said . "" What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the lowest price being paid by anyone in the world ,"" he said . The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the U . S . and that they are entitled to the best price , he said . Government and commodity sources also said there are elements in the USDA , most notably undersecretary Daniel Amstutz , who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets . "" Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a foregone conclusion ,"" the State Department official said ."
370,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN DROUGHTS Three geographically diverse droughts in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a reintensification of the complex and little - understood El Nino weather pattern , & lt ; Accu - Weather Inc >, a commercial weather forecasting service , said . Rice and wheat farmers in China , wheat and sugarcane growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive in time to break the droughts , offical reports , government officials and meteorologists said . Wen Wei Po , a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links , said the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months . Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces , it added . Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan was 70 pct below average during February , the lowest figure for over 20 years , the paper said . The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many rivers , it added . This has resulted in reduced hydro - electric power , causing shortages to industry and households . The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century , causing many ships to run aground , Wen Wei Po said . Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across China , media reports said . The People ' s Daily said Sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average since early February . The New China News Agency said the average December temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984 . Severe drought is affecting about one - third of Sri Lanka and threatens to reduce the country ' s tea crop , Ministry of Plantation Industries officials told Reuters In Australia , concern is growing about below - average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the Queensland coast and in Western Australia ' s wheat belt , local Meteorological Bureau officials said . For many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major threat , the prospect of a dry autumn / winter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does , they added . Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982 / 83 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as El Nino , they said . Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the Asia - Pacific region ' s disrupted weather patterns to any single cause , El Nino ' s role is being closely studied , they said . Accu - Weather Inc , which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests , said each El Nino ' event ' was unique . The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last major event in 1982 / 83 , it said . El Nino , Spanish for "" Christ Child "" because it appears around Christmas , is formed by the action of warm air , bearing clouds and rain , shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast of Peru , where it mingles with the cold waters associated with the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade winds , meteorologists said . The winds , strengthened by El Nino ' s "" pump "" effect , raise the sea level off Australia and Indonesia , they said . When the winds drop , the ocean , seeking equilibrium , sends a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it collides with the cold seas off Peru , they said . One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the rain - bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the Pacific , where they further disrupt other weather patterns . The prospects for an end to the droughts vary , Accu - Weather said . China , where the affected areas have received between 40 and 75 pct of normal rainfall , will have to wait for the May - September rains , it said . The May - September rains normally provide the drought - striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall . In Australia , areas of Queensland ' s coastal strip have received less than half the normal rainfall during the current wet season , but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end . In Sri Lanka , the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year . The year ' s secondary rains usually occur between April and June , although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual ."

S . grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week USDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium at the Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS posted prices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement . But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes . "" If people are suggesting that we are going to make wholesale changes in pricing , we are not considering this ,"" he said . Sindt , however , did not rule out the possiblity of implementing more minor changes in its pricing system . "" We are continually monitoring the whole nationwide structure to maintain its accuracy ,"" he said . "" If we become convinced that we need to make a change , then appropriate adjustments will be made ."" Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDA ' s price differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interior markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge freight rates . He said commodity operations deputy administrator Ralph Klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour and will meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week . Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at that meeting , including the current concern over the gulf corn premiums . He defended the USDA differentials , saying that these price margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or decrease . The USDA official also said that only those counties that use the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices . When asked if the USDA emergency storage program which allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space and accounting for the higher freight rates , Sindt discounted the idea . He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges and that , under provisions of the program , these all have to be emptied by the end of March ."
375,"CONCERN OVER "" EL NINO "" IN PERU - USDA REPORT There are heightened fears that "" El Nino "" may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the 1983 disaster , which affected the weather on several continents and caused widespread damage through floods and drought , the U . S . Agriculture Department ' s officer in Lima said in a field report . Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area , flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led to increased concern , the report , dated March 17 , said . However , it said official sources still believe that this year ' s El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity . EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds and waters in the pacific . The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now being experienced has not had an overall negative impact on agricultural production . Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduce yields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in the crop cycle . Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive where excessive moisture exists , it said . However , the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supply of irrigation water in the major dams which will improve prospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn , and slow the decline in sugar production , it said . If El Nino picks up momentum , Peru ' s fishing industry could receive a setback . But trade sources still believe the fish catch for industrial processing will reach 5 . 5 mln tonnes in 1987 , almost 20 pct above last year , the report said . Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are three to four degrees centigrade above normal but still not high enough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters , it said . It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino will intensify and carry on through late March , April and May causing problems as crops approach harvest . "" There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino -- only time will tell ,"" the report said ."
376,"ANALYST SAYS USSR WINTER GRAINS HURT BY WEATHER The Soviet Union ' s winter grain crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting conditions last fall and severe cold this winter , an analyst of world weather and crop conditions said . Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell , author of the EF Hutton publication "" Global Crop News ,"" said in her latest report that the Soviets may import more grain , possibly wheat , from the U . S . due to potential crop damage . "" Compared with last year , the outlook ( for the Soviet winter grain crop ) is far more pessimistic ,"" she said . "" But it ' s still too early to talk about disastrous losses . A lot will depend on spring weather , not only for the outcome of the troubled winter grain crop , but also for spring planting ."" Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains . Key wheat growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus received on 25 - 35 pct of autumn precipitation , she said . The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record lows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its toll on Soviet winter crops , she said . However , she noted that most of the southern grain belt had ample snow cover , which should have well - insulated the majority of crop areas from severe frost damage . The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains in the July 1986 / June 1987 marketing year , primarily from Canada , the European Community , Argentina and Australia , Martell said . She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand . Last fall ' s dry weather may limit livestock grazing on moisture - depleted pastures , while the cold winter weather necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy . Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986 grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes , and said the Chernobyl accident may have contaminated more grain than originally thought and have to be made up with imports . However , she said the U . S . remains a supplier of last resort for the Soviet Union , noting that the Soviets have only just recently begun their first U . S . grain purchases of the 1986 / 87 season by buying 2 . 25 mln tonnes of corn . Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980 grain embargo the U . S . is only a major supplier of grain to the USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand . In 1984 / 85 , the U . S . supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain imports of 55 . 5 mln tonnes . But in 1985 / 86 , the Soviet Union bought 29 . 9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U . S . for only 24 pct of that total . While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986 / 87 was 22 mln tonnes , many U . S . grain analysts have revised their estimates of Soviet imports up to 25 - 28 mln tonnes , she said ."

S . Agriculture Department said . In a summary of its World Agriculture Report , the department said grain production in sub - Saharan Africa was a record high in 1986 , with gains in almost every country . However , food needs in Central America rose , worsened by drought - reduced crops and civil strife . Record wheat production in 1986 / 87 is pushing global wheat consumption for food to a new high , and higher yielding varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat is a common crop , it said . However , may developing countries in tropical climates , such as Sub - Saharan Africa , Southeast Asia , and Central America , are not well adapted for wheat production , and improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs , the department said . World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in 1986 / 87 for the third straight year . Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil consumption , while palm oil is the most traded , the department said ."
380,"U . S . SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA The U . S . Agriculture Department formally transmitted to Congress a long - awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments . In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying the "" Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987 "", Peter Myers , Deputy Agriculture Secretary , said the Reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop , down from 18 cts now . Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991 . The payments would cost an estimated 1 . 1 billion dlrs , Myers said . The administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep . John Porter , R - Ill . Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because politically - influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist . The direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years . It also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20 , 000 short tons raw sugar per grower . For example , on the first 350 tons of production , a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988 , 4 . 5 cts in 1989 , 3 cts in 1990 and 1 . 5 cts in 1991 . The income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years , whichever is less , USDA said . Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry . He said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads . U . S . sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a "" progressive contraction "" of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year , he said . This has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing . Furthermore , USDA said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar - containing products a competitive advantage . The result has been higher imports of sugar - containing products and a flight of U . S . processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar . USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on U . S . consumers and industrial users . In fiscal 1987 , USDA said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar . "" Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing ,"" Myers said . The following table lists the rate of payments , in cts per lb , to growers and the quantity covered , in short tons recoverable raw sugar , under the administration ' s proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments .

381,"STRIKE THREAT , LOWER TRAFFIC MAR SEAWAY OPENING The St . Lawrence Seaway , set to reopen March 31 after the winter , faces another tough year because of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of the first strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes , seaway officials said . Depressed grain exports , rising costs , and competing modes of transportation are all expected to result in only a marginal increase over last year ' s traffic levels -- and revenues -- on the 2 , 300 mile waterway , officials said . In 1986 , a season that ran from April 3 to December 27 , the seaway moved 37 . 6 mln metric tons of freight between Montreal and Lake Ontario and 41 . 6 mln tons on the Welland Canal , linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario . By comparison , in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveled through the Montreal - Lake Ontario section and 42 mln through the eight - lock canal . The waterway is expected to lose 9 - 10 mln Canadian dlrs this year , about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal 1986 - 87 ending March 31 , said William Blair , an executive member of Canada ' s St Lawrence Seaway Authority . The seaway moves about one - half of Canada ' s exported grain . Those exports of the single most important commodity carried on the waterway have been depressed by world surpluses . The Seafarers ' International Union , which represents about 2 , 300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts , has said it will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers ' demands for wage rollbacks and other concessions . "" It ' s 99 . 9 pct ( certain )-- I guarantee you a strike ,"" Roman Gralewicz , head of the Seafarers ' Canadian branch , has said . The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliator to try to hammer out a contract agreement between the two sides . The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on the Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic . "" We haven ' t had a strike on the seaway for years ... a prolonged strike would have a disasterous effect ,"" Seaway Authority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said . "" These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the St Lawrence Seaway ,"" George Miller , vice - president of the Canadian Lake Carriers Association , an association of major Canadian shipping companies , said recently . The workers ' current contract expires May 31 . The association said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages for the next three years , reduced crew levels and the power to restructure crew dispatching . The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs ( U . S .) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and freight rates and increasing competition . The seaway said 1985 was its worst year in two decades . Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on the Welland Canal by eight pct this year , compared to last year ' s 15 pct rise , while maintaining a freeze on tolls throughout the rest of the waterway . Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway ' s 15 locks and about 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs . "" We may see and hope for a steady upward climb ... but we won ' t see a major increase for a number of years ,"" Hemsley said . A Canada - U . S . delegation to promote the seaway to shippers in Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this season but the full benefits won ' t be felt for several years , Blair said ."

For the first stage Beghin - Say will issue some 2 . 05 mln new 65 franc shares at 500 francs to increase capital to 660 mln francs . The share currently trades at 734 francs . Then 658 , 000 new 65 franc investment certificates will be issued at 400 francs , raising capital to 703 mln francs . The capital increase will bring the group around 1 . 2 billion francs in new funds to finance its expansion plans . These include the possible acquisition of the Corn Products maize starch plant at Haubourdin in northern France , Vernes said . Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all of Corn Products ' installations in Europe . Apart from the French plant , these include three factories in each of Italy and West Germany , two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlands and Denmark . Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on the installations , and Beghin - Say estimates that acquisition of the Haubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs , Vernes said .

But there was no reason to expect Australian production in 1987 / 88 would be less than the 16 . 5 mln tonnes of last year , the private forecaster said , as crops in New South Wales and Queensland suffered from poor yields last season . Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western Australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks , it said . The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a poor profit outlook under cost , credit and yield pressures . But in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and June is not less than average , AWF said . Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back wheat area by 20 pct , AWF said this was unlikely since they needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative crops . "" The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds , pulses and oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a high proportion of growers ' income ,"" AWF said .

389,"RAINS PROMISE BOUNTIFUL CROPS IN ETHIOPIA Rain over wide areas has raised the prospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia , which suffered a disastrous drought and famine two years ago . Aweke Aynalem , head of the government ' s Agriculture Development Department , told reporters prospects were good for attaining the target of 250 , 000 tonnes of grain in the present growing season , one of two each year in Ethiopia . Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648 , 000 tonnes a year , of which 250 , 000 tonnes are produced from the "" belg "" ( small ) rains which fall at this time of year . The belg rains are used to plant quick - maturing crops like maize and barley . Any shortfall during this period affects production in the main rainy season , because farmers eat their stocks of seed . Aweke said peasants in Wello , Tigre and Hararghe -- regions which suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sow their crops because of the favourable rains . The government had distributed large quantities of seed and fertiliser , and the rains should ensure a good crop ."

393,"PORTUGUESE GRAIN AGENCY BAN OPPOSED BY MINISTER Portugal ' s Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders . Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted to the tenders . Under the terms of Portugal ' s January 1986 accession to the European Community ( EC ), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC ( Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais ) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990 . Following legal proceedings by private importers , Lisbon ' s civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part , as it had done , in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports . As a result of this ruling , EPAC was excluded from a March 12 tender for the import of 80 , 000 tonnes of maize . Barreto said , "" My objective is put EPAC into the tenders because it has a right to take part ."" He added the government would be studying the court order to see whether or not the ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders . Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator , whether public or private , from the tenders . Private traders had argued that EPAC , given its dominant position in the Portuguese grain market , had an unfair advantage over them . "" There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system ,"" Barreto said . He said the EC ' s executive commission had accepted the government ' s view that EPAC should be eligible . The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC ' s participation in the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the clauses of Portugal ' s EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency ' s import monopoly ."

409,"ILLINOIS CO - OP FUTURES DISSOLUTION VOTE SET The shareholders of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co ., the futures trading arm of many Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years , will vote Wednesday on its possible dissolution . The directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month , citing falling volume and increasing costs . Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout of Growmark , Inc ., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital stock , led to the call for dissolution . The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership . Ironically , it was Growmark , at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators , that founded Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1 , 1960 . But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur , Ill ., and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies , ADM / Growmark . With that relationship , Growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative , said Tom Mulligan , president of the co - op . Membership in the company , which Mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives , has declined from 99 in 1982 . A notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa , which became affiliated with Cargill , Inc . Illinois Co - op ' s other members include such regional cooperatives as Indiana Grain , based in Indianapolis , Goldkist , of Atlanta , Ga ., Midstates in Toledo , Ohio , Farmland Industries in Kansas City , Mo ., Farmers Commodities , Des Moines , and Harvest States in Minneapolis . Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co . is a serious blow to the cooperative system . Instead of banding together , the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways , said the floor manager of one cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade . Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant , he said . Don Hanes , vice president for communications with the National Council of Farm Cooperatives , said 5 , 600 cooperatives exist today , down from 6 , 700 five years ago . "" The period we ' ve gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch ,"" he said . "" There ' s been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co - ops ."" One problem , he said , is the co - ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export , rather than exporting it themselves , losing potential profits . But exporting grain requires heavy investments , and the multi - million - dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers Export Co ., a co - op set up to export grains , served "" to make folks gun - shy ,"" Hanes said . Mulligan said he believes the dissolution , if it is approved , is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in U . S . agricultural economics . A grain dealer at one member co - op said the futures arm "" was a convenience , something that saved us a little bit of money .

414,"U . S . CORN ACREAGE SEEN NEAR RECORD LOW U . S . corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty years , Agriculture Department officials said . USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31 . Agriculture Department analysts said next week ' s figures will likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres , down 22 pct from last year ' s plantings of 83 . 3 mln acres . Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings , U . S . corn production will also decrease significantly . Analysts said 1987 corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to around seven billion bushels . Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains program , along with 1 . 9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation program , will cause acreage to plummet , Department feedgrain analysts said . "" There ' s no question that there will be a sharp decrease in corn acreage ,"" one said . "" It ' s difficult for any farmer to not go along with the program this year ."" Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but at a much slower rate of around four pct , USDA analysts said . Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below , they said , compared to last year ' s level of 61 . 5 mln acres . If analysts ' unofficial estimates prove correct then the drop in u . s . corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment - In - Kind program . Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983 . A severe drought that summer in major producing states caused yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4 . 2 billion bushels . Given normal weather conditions this year , USDA analysts said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion bushels , down from last year ' s crop of 8 . 3 billion bushels . "" This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant reduction in production ,"" an analyst said . A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U . S . corn usage , so surplus stocks , while not decreasing , would not increase significantly , a specialist said . High producing corn belt states are expected to show the greatest acreage reductions , based upon historical participation in government programs , analysts said . In contrast , soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western corn belt , a USDA soybean analyst said . "" Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge ,"" he said . Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in higher - producing delta areas . Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year ' s 2 . 0 billion bushels to 1 . 8 to 1 . 9 billion , he said . U . S . soybean acreage , after soaring to 71 . 4 mln acres in 1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that , has steadily declined in the 1980 ' s . U . S . corn acreage , with the exception of 1983 , has been in the low to mid 80 - mln acre range for the past 10 years . The highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln acres and obtained average yields of 26 . 5 bushels per acre . Last year U . S . farmers obtained record corn yields averaging 119 . 3 bushels per acre . "" We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so ,"" an analyst said . Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as long as government program provisions remain the same , analysts said . Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15 pct of their acreage . "" To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres , we would have to provide more incentives ,"" an analyst said ."

The bill , approved by voice vote , would establish trade missions made up of representatives of the Departments of Agriculture and State , the Agency for International Development , the Overseas Private Investment Corp , market development cooperatives and private voluntary organizations . At least 16 missions would have to be sent within one year after enactment of the bill . The missions would promote U .

The panel agreed to drop a provision in the original bill , offered by Sen . John Melcher ( D - Mont .), that would have required the U . S . Agriculture Department to donate at least one mln tonnes of surplus commodities to developing countries . Current law requires USDA to donate at least 750 , 000 tonnes of surplus grains and dairy products under the Section 416 food donation program . The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposed increase in the minimum tonnage requirement would have cost up to 50 mln dlrs per year , Senate staff said . The committee also dropped a provision identifying which countries would be the focus of the trade missions ' activities . Under the bill adopted by the committee , countries "" friendly to the United States "" would be eligible to host the trade missions . Melcher originally had proposed sending missions to Mexico , the Philippines , Indonesia , Bangladesh , Senegal , Nigeria , Peru , Kenya , the Dominican Republic , Costa Rica , Malaysia , Venezuela , Tunisia and Morocco . The bill also would require the Foreign Agricultural Service , FAS , to have at least 850 full - time employees during fiscal years 1987 - 89 .

420,"U . S . SUGAR POLICY MAY SELF - DESTRUCT , CONGRESSMAN A leading U . S . farm - state Congressman , Jerry Huckaby , D - La ., warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners , perhaps including corn sweeteners , if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year . "" We ' re moving toward a direction where we could self - destruct ( the U . S . sugar program ),"" Rep . Huckaby , chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues , told Reuters in an interview . Huckaby , who told U . S . sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases , said he will deliver the same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday . He also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject . Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota , now at one mln short tons . "" I think if we ' re talking about dropping ( the quota ) another half mln tons , lets say , you ' re getting to the point where the program might not work ,"" he said . "" Ideally , I ' d like to freeze things right where we are ,"" said Huckaby , leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress . A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of 6 . 5 mln tons , the corn sweetener share of the U . S . market staying at just over 50 pct , and U . S sugar imports holding at about 1 . 2 mln tons , Huckaby said . A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year , he said . "" I feel like if we didn ' t expand production , we could probably hold where we are indefinitely , or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes ( in the sugar program ),"" Huckaby said . However , much depends on whether high - fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the U . S . sweetener market from just over 50 pct , Huckaby said . He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the U . S . But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share , then U . S . sugar imports might be eliminated and U . S . sugar output severely reduced . Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as A . E . Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon . "" This program is advantageous to the corn users . They have some natural , legitimate self - interest in seeing that the program is preserved ,"" Huckaby said . Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled , either through production allocations , acreage or marketing controls . Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production . "" I don ' t know if we will go this route , but if we do there ' s a question in my mind at this point in time ; can you do that legally ?"" he said . Asked if he would proceed with production controls without the support of corn refiners , Huckaby said "" You build a fragile house if you do it that way ."" Huckaby said he understands why U . S . cane and beet farmers have expanded production , because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain . But he said for sugar growers as a whole , expansion would not be good policy . Huckaby said he has tried to stress , in his speeches to sugar industry groups , that if growers continue to expand , they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year . Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program . "" The administration proposal is so drastic , that I don ' t think it will get up a head of steam ,"" Huckaby said . He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved . Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program , Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the European Community ' s sugar policy . He said EC policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market ."
421,"ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER Argentine grain producers again reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986 / 87 soybean crop , which will begin to be harvested in mid - April , trade sources said . They said growers now forecast soybean production this season at between 7 . 5 and 7 . 8 mln tonnes , down from last week ' s estimate of 7 . 7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8 . 0 to 8 . 4 mln tonnes forecast in mid - February . The new forecast is still higher than last season ' s record total production . Private sources put 1985 / 86 production at a record 7 . 2 to 7 . 3 mln tonnes -- 4 . 2 to 6 . 4 pct lower than the new forecast for the current crop . The official figure for 1985 / 86 is 7 . 1 mln tonnes , 5 . 6 to 9 . 9 pct below this season ' s new estimates . Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe provinces and northern Buenos Aires . The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures and inadequate rainfall . Growers fear they may find more empty pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield . The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3 . 7 to 3 . 8 mln hectares , 10 . 8 to 13 . 8 pct higher than the 1985 / 86 record of 3 . 34 mln hectares . The state of the crop continued to be good in general until last week but intense , heavy rains since could have caused damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm . Where the rains were less heavy they were considered beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates . The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to influence production forecasts . In other areas , especially western Buenos Aires , where rainfall was more than 200 mm , parts of the sunflower , maize and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged . The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba , La Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios . The area sown with maize this season was between 3 . 58 and 3 . 78 mln hectares , two to seven pct less than the 3 . 85 mln hectares in 1985 / 86 . The yield of 1986 / 87 maize continued to be forecast at between 9 . 9 and 10 . 1 mln tonnes . This estimate is 19 . 8 to 20 . 2 pct lower than the 12 . 4 to 12 . 6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985 / 86 production and 21 . 1 to 22 . 7 pct lower than the official 12 . 8 mln tonnes . The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods . A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of sunshine dries the fields . The area sown this season was 2 . 0 to 2 . 2 mln hectares , down 29 . 9 to 36 . 3 pct on last year ' s record 3 . 14 mln hectares . Sunflowerseed 1986 / 87 production is still forecast at 2 . 3 to 2 . 6 mln tonnes , 34 . 1 to 41 . 5 pct below the 1985 / 86 record of 4 . 1 mln tonnes . The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the rains , advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown . The area sown was 1 . 23 to 1 . 30 mln hectares , 10 . 3 to 15 . 2 pct less than the 1 . 45 mln hectares the previous season . Yield estimates remained at 3 . 2 to 3 . 5 mln tonnes , 16 . 7 to 22 pct down on 1985 / 86 production of 4 . 1 to 4 . 2 mln tonnes ."
422,"COST OF PIK CERTIFICATES TO BE EYED BY CONGRESS Congress , eager to find budget savings , launches a review of the U . S . Agriculture Department ' s generic commodity certificate program tomorrow , amid signs USDA and the General Accounting Office , GAO , are at odds over how much the program has cost U . S . taxpayers . The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that payment - in - kind , or PIK , certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays , administration officials who asked not to be identified said . USDA officials , however , took issue with the report , saying it did not take into account storage , handling and transport savings that accrue to the government . The GAO then decided to re - examine the costs , sources said . The issue is an important one , because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as a means of cutting spending . Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow . Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays , and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp , CCC , almost equal costs , department sources said . USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents to store , handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in government storage . It was unclear whether the GAO , Congress ' investigative arm , would stick by its original analysis that it costs the government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm price and income support programs , Reagan administration sources said . The GAO is expected to point out that use of payment - in - kind , PIK , certificates has helped relieve tight storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been sold . The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of PIK certificates . The CCC issues dollar - denominated PIK certificates , or certs , as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters . Certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or cash . Between April and December 1986 , CCC issued 3 . 8 billion dlrs worth of certificates , according to USDA . Up to another 6 . 7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and August 1987 , according to USDA . Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate . Eliminating this practice , called "" PIK and roll ,"" would save the government 1 . 4 billion dlrs between 1988 - 92 , according to the Congressional Budget Office , CBO . That estimate , according to a CBO official , was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments . The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be considering curbs on PIK - and - roll transactions among other savings alternatives . The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs , or between five and 20 pct , more than cash outlays , one administration official said . However , the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on USDA criticism , department officials said . The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of a crop year . USDA ' s Economic Research Service , for example , has found that between June and August last year , the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel . Between September and November , however , certificates had only a marginal impact on corn prices , according to the ERS study , obtained by Reuters ."

427,"IWC LIFTS WORLD GRAIN OUTPUT ESTIMATE TO RECORD The International Wheat Council ( IWC ) lifted its estimate for 1986 / 87 world wheat and coarse grain production by one mln tonnes to a record 1 , 377 mln , compared with 1 , 351 mln tonnes the previous season . In its monthly market report , the IWC said it is leaving unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming 1987 / 88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a record 534 mln in 1986 / 87 . The one mln tonne upward revision in 1986 / 87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments . The IWC raised the 1986 / 87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to 87 mln tonnes . It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln . The IWC 1986 / 87 estimate for world trade in wheat and coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere . The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987 / 88 is likely to be down from last year as low world prices and restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect . At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries . There is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off . Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain outlook , the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the European Community but increase in Canada . U . S . Maize area is expected lower but oat sowings could rise . After damage to its maize crop last year , the Soviet Union plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be resown to this and other spring crops . Improved weather and a further increase in the use of intensive cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet maize output in 1987 , the IWC said . Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986 / 87 , the IWC said . It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at endof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln tonnes , respectively , against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier . After record world durum wheat production of 218 . 8 mln tonnes last season , the IWC said there are already signs of another large crop this coming season with higher output expected in the EC , Canada , the U . S . And North Africa ."
428,"IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED Efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success , the International Wheat Council ( IWC ) says in its latest monthly report . Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas , as employed in the United States , the IWC says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters - Argentina , Australia , Canada , the EC and the U . S . In some countries , for example Australia and Argentina , which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income , there may be problems in reducing production . A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment , with job prospects outside agriculture limited . Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems . The IWC outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries . They could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated . Alternatively , support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold , without needing to be stored for a long period . This option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production , the report said . The third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture , possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production . The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982 . At some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses . These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency . For example between 1985 / 86 and 1986 / 87 the EC intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209 . 30 to 179 . 44 European currency units ( Ecus ). It dollar terms , the currency in which most export transactions are denominated , the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168 . The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure , the report says . The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987 . This was partly due to increased production in China and India . The period saw an upward trend in yields , although this was countered in the Argentina , the U . S . And Australia by lower acreages . In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises , particularly livestock while lower U . S . Acreages are attributed to official incentives ."

430,"DUTCH GRAIN LEVY TEST CASE TO START IN APRIL A large Dutch animal feed compounder will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test case on the way the EC grain co - responsibility levy is applied , a spokesman for Dutch grain and feed trade association , Het Comite , told Reuters . Het Comite has been co - ordinating national actions against alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and , since December , has lodged more than 80 individual cases with the Business Appeal Court in The Hague . The basic complaint is that the levy does not take account of currency cross - rates of exchange and therefore compounders in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another country . Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement that companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy rather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch grain commodity board . The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial and legal backing to the test case in the Business Administration Court in the Hague . Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10 . The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the company for the test case from among the 80 lodged "" because the bill ( the firm ) received from the commodity board for payment of the levy contained significant currency distortions and involved grain from a wide variety of origins ."" The name of the company is not being made public . The Administration Court is not expected to make a final ruling on the case in the near future . The Het Comite spokesman said it was very likely it would refer questions to the Appeal Court in Luxembourg , and "" as a result it could easily be another nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved ."" Meanwhile , the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders are putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutch government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a complete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy is collected , the spokesman said . Het Comite , as a member of FEFAC , the association of European animal feed manufacturers , is also a party to actions protesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court ."

2,"FRANCE WILL FIGHT EC FARM PROPOSALS - MINISTER French Agricultural Minister Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject proposed reforms of the European Community , EC , cereals , sugar and oilseeds sectors , which he said would disrupt these markets . The EC Commission ' s proposals to shorten the intervention period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in lower real prices for producers , he told farmers here . "" I give you my word that France , while it will not reject technical adjustments or serious discussion , will simply reply in the negative to these bad reforms ,"" Guillaume told the annual conference of the country ' s major farm union , FNSEA ( Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles ). Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling EC output and fix farm prices for 1987 / 88 . Relations between the government and farmers have become strained in France in recent months . There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and further cutbacks in Community milk output . But Guillaume ' s warning that he would reject reorganisation of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the FNSEA ' s farmers . His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary Compensatory Amounts , MCA ' s , however , are unlikely to avoid further protests by producers . Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad against the EC Commission ' s proposals to overhaul the farm sector . "" The Minister ' s proposals back up our determination to organise union action in the coming weeks ,"" he told reporters , adding that this could also act in Guillaume ' s favour on a ministerial level . Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being appointed farm minister last spring . Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister . There have been certain advances on cutting production costs , reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid , but there are still areas where more could be done such as on farmers ' indebtedness , he said . Guillaume told the conference the government will make available 2 . 4 billion francs ( 396 mln dlrs ) to help producers reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire . The government has already announced financial aid for the milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package announced today was new aid , Lacombe said ."
3,"PHILIPPINES TO LOBBY U . S . FOR HIGHER SUGAR QUOTA The Philippines will ask the U . S . Agriculture Department ( USDA ) to increase its 1987 sugar import quota following market reports that Taiwan will not be able to fulfil its quota , Sugar Regulation Administration ( SRA ) chairman Arsenim Yulo said . Yulo told Reuters the SRA would also protest a USDA move to award Taiwan ' s shortfall to the Dominican Republic . The Dominican Republic already has a larger sugar quota , Yulo said . "" Any Taiwanese shortfall should be awarded to the Philippines or at the least we should share a hike with the Dominican Republic ."" The USDA last December listed 1987 sugar import quota allocations for the Dominican Republic at 160 , 160 short tons and for Taiwan at 10 , 920 short tons . The Philippines has said it was badly hit by a cut in its quota to 143 , 780 short tons from 231 , 660 in 1986 ."
4,"PHILIPPINE SUGAR CROP SET AT 1 . 6 MLN TONNES Philippine sugar production in the 1987 / 88 crop year ending August has been set at 1 . 6 mln tonnes , up from a provisional 1 . 3 mln tonnes this year , Sugar Regulatory Administration ( SRA ) chairman Arsenio Yulo said . Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling season , which ends next month , showed the 1986 / 87 estimate would almost certainly be met . He said at least 1 . 2 mln tonnes of the 1987 / 88 crop would be earmarked for domestic consumption . Yulo said about 130 , 000 tonnes would be set aside for the U . S . Sugar quota , 150 , 000 tonnes for strategic reserves and 50 , 000 tonnes would be sold on the world market . He said if the government approved a long - standing SRA recommendation to manufacture ethanol , the project would take up another 150 , 000 tonnes , slightly raising the target . "" The government , for its own reasons , has been delaying approval of the project , but we expect it to come through by July ,"" Yulo said . Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline , cutting the oil import bill by about 300 mln pesos . Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved . The ethanol project would result in employment for about 100 , 000 people , sharply reducing those thrown out of work by depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry . Production quotas , set for the first time in 1987 / 88 , had been submitted to President Corazon Aquino . "" I think the President would rather wait till the new Congress convenes after the May elections ,"" he said . "" But there is really no need for such quotas . We are right now producing just slightly over our own consumption level ."" "" The producers have never enjoyed such high prices ,"" Yulo said , adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos per picul , up from 190 pesos last August . Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation following the SRA ' s bid to control production . "" We are no longer concerned so much with the world market ,"" he said , adding producers in the Negros region had learned from their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and cloth production . He said diversification into products other than ethanol was also possible within the sugar industry . "" The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons ,"" Yulo said . "" They have 300 sugar mills , compared with our 41 , but they relocated many of them and diversified production . We want to call this a ' sugarcane industry ' instead of the sugar industry ."" He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock , used for thatching roofs , or used in room panelling . "" When you cut sugarcane you don ' t even have to produce sugar ,"" he said . Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the International Sugar Agreement , which expired in 1984 . "" As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new agreement which would revive world prices ,"" Yulo said . "" If there is no agreement world prices will always be depressed , particularly because the European Community is subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets ."" He said current world prices , holding steady at about 7 . 60 cents per pound , were uneconomical for the Philippines , where production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound . "" If the price holds steady for a while at 7 . 60 cents I expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end of this year ,"" he said . Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by 1990 , with world consumption outstripping production . He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments from artificial sweeteners and high - fructose corn syrup . "" But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration ,"" he said . "" Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the U . S . In 1982 , when they restored the quota system , they cut ours in half without any justification ."" Manila was keenly watching Washington ' s moves to cut domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents . The U . S . Agriculture Department last December slashed its 12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to 143 , 780 short tons from 231 , 660 short tons in 1986 . Yulo said despite next year ' s increased production target , some Philippine mills were expected to shut down . "" At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the 1986 / 87 season ,"" he said . "" We expect two or three more to follow suit during the next season ."""
5,"SUGAR MARKET SEES GOOD RECENT OFFTAKE Reports the Soviet Union has lately extended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight raws cargoes from the free market at around 30 / 40 points under New York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand for sugar for a variety of destinations , traders said . The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India , Turkey and Libya , as well as possible raws offtake by China . Some 300 , 000 to 400 , 000 tonnes could have changed hands in current activity , which is encouraging for a sugar trade which previously saw little worthwhile end - buyer enquiry , they added . Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the Soviet Union in the past few days involved Japanese operators selling Thai origin sugar . Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightened considerably recently due to good Far Eastern demand , possibly for sales to the Soviet Union or to pre - empt any large block enquiries by China , they said . Thai prices for March / May 15 shipments have hardened to around 13 / 14 points under May New York from larger discounts previously , they added . Traders said the Soviet Union might be looking to buy more sugar in the near term , possibly towards an overall requirement this year of around two mln tonnes . It is probable that some 1 . 8 mln tonnes have already been taken up , they said . Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100 , 000 tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases of two to three cargoes for Mar / Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne cost and freight and could be seeking more . Libya was also a buyer this week , taking two cargoes of whites which , for an undisclosed shipment period , were reported priced around 229 / 230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight , they added . Futures prices reacted upwards to the news of end - buyer physicals offtake , although much of the enquiry emerged recently when prices took an interim technical dip , traders said . Pakistan is lined up shortly to buy 100 , 000 tonnes of whites although traders said the tender , originally scheduled for tomorrow , might not take place until a week later . Egypt will be seeking 20 , 000 tonnes of May arrival white sugar next week , while Greece has called an internal EC tender for 40 , 000 tonnes of whites to be held in early April , for arrival in four equal parts in May , June , July and August ."
6,"EC EXTENDS PARTS OF FREE FOOD FOR POOR SCHEME A scheme to distribute surplus food free to the poor in the European Community ( EC ), which was due to expire next Tuesday , will be partially extended for a further month , an EC Commission spokesman said . He added the executive Commission has not yet decided whether the scheme should become a permanent feature of the EC ' s struggle to find a use for its massive stocks of farm produce . Almost 60 , 000 tonnes of cereals , sugar , beef , butter and other food have been authorised for distribution under an operation sanctioned by EC farm ministers on January 20 in which charities act as executive Commission agents . The original idea was to help the needy survive this year ' s unusually cold European winter . The spokesman said the Commission was extending the scheme fully in Greece , which has recently been hit by unseasonal snowstorms , for the month of April . Other EC countries would be authorised to use stocks of food for which they have already applied under the scheme up to April 30 . The spokesman said this would enable distribution of flour , semolina , sugar and olive oil at a relatively high rate next month . He said the Commission , which has powers to continue most aspects of the scheme without consulting ministers further , will be considering soon whether it should be made permanent . Cost , which has already reached around 65 mln European currency units , would be a major consideration . End - January stocks included 1 . 28 mln tonnes of butter , 520 , 000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals ."

8,"AUSTRALIAN SUGAR AREAS SAID RECEIVING SOME RAIN Dry areas of the Australian sugar cane belt along the Queensland coast have been receiving just enough rain to sustain the 1987 crop , an Australian Sugar Producers Association spokesman said . The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago , but rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are needed in some areas , notably in the Burdekin and Mackay regions , he said from Brisbane . Elsewhere , in the far north and the far south of the state and in northern New South Wales , the cane crop is looking very good after heavy falls this month , he said . The spokesman said it is still too early to tell what effect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop , which is harvested from around June to December . He said frequent but light falls in the areas that are short of moisture , such as Mackay , mean they really only need about three days of the region ' s heavy tropical rains to restore normal moisture to the cane . But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial to the size of the crop in the dry areas , he said . "" It ' s certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but it might be in a month without some good falls ,"" he said ."

13,"ANALYSTS APPLAUD CSR ' S BOLD MOVE TO SELL DELHI CSR Ltd & lt ; CSRA . S > has made a bold move in selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business , share analysts said . "" It sounds like a good deal ,"" Stuart McKibbin of & lt ; A . C . Goode and Co > told Reuters . CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the & lt ; Delhi Australia Fund > and would instead sell it to Exxon Corp & lt ; XON > unit & lt ; Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc > for 985 mln dlrs . In a twin announcement CSR , already Australia ' s largest sugar refiner , made a 2 . 20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in & lt ; Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd >. "" This will be a big shock to the market , which was under the impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi ,"" McKibbin said . A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs , but in opting to sell outright , CSR had given itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best - performing divisions of sugar and building products , analysts said . CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an oil price over 20 U . S . Dlrs a barrel in the next two years . Delhi is one of Australia ' s largest onshore oil producers yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin . Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs . Neale Goldston - Morris of Sydney broker & lt ; Bain and Co Ltd > said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of Australian - owned assets to a foreign company . "" The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold back to the Americans ,"" Goldston - Morris said . The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the largest player in Australia ' s 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country , analysts said . They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices . Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year , they said . Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging investment , made in 1981 , which has dragged down the company ' s overall performance , analysts said . CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on what had been a 591 mln U . S . Dlr investment financed entirely from U . S . Dollar debt , they said . "" It was a bad investment for them . They financed it entirely with debt , the currency collapsed on them and then the oil price collapsed on them ,"" Owen Evans of Sydney broker & lt ; Meares and Philips Ltd > said . Esso not only picked up Delhi ' s oil and gas output but also gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions . Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50 / 50 Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd & lt ; BRKN . S >. "" Esso has been very keen to diversify from the Gippsland Basin . They haven ' t found too much oil in Bass Strait lately and Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production ,"" Goldston - Morris said ."
14,"COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET Consuming countries , chastened by the collapse of International Tin Council ( ITC ) price support operations in 1985 , are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving , a Reuter survey showed . They want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords ' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non - members undermining the pacts . Consumers and producers , mindful of ITC buffer stock losses , have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations . Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case , the survey showed . The International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) last week set precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager ( BSM ) could do under the new agreement . It imposed daily and weekly purchase limits , prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets and stipulated , after consumer insistence , that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non - member cocoa . This will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia , the world ' s fourth largest producer , undermining the market . The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades . A new International Natural Rubber Agreement ( INRA ) was adopted earlier this month in Geneva . Importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations . Direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases . Bank financing was a particular feature of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling . Legal wrangles continue . Recent International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) negotiations in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality , commodity analysts said . Consumers and a small group of producers argued that "" objective criteria "" should be used to define export quota shares , which would have meant a reduction in the share of Brazil , the world ' s leading producer . Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct . The talks broke down and , although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today , delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote . International agreements exist for sugar and wheat . These do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements , collect statistics and draw up market analyses . Analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth , while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat . An alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups , made up of governments with advice from industry , such as those for lead and zinc and rubber . The U . N . Common fund for commodities , with a planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs , has failed to become operational because neither the U . S . Nor the Soviet Union has ratified it . U . S . Officials in Washington said the U . S . Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives , citing the lack of widespread support . U . S . Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case . U . S . Officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound , market - oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests . "" We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose long - term trend is downward ,"" official Administration policy states . The U . S . Currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement ( ICA ) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts . The U . S . Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries , the State Department said . U . S . Officials singled out the INRA as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working . U . S . Negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement , U . S . Officials said . Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case . Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country , the world ' s top producer of rubber , tin and palm oil , decides its participation in international commodity pacts case by case . Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing Countries ( ATPC ) which produce 65 pct of world tin . The ATPC launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96 , 000 tonnes for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50 , 000 from 70 , 000 . Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and delegate to cocoa , wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told Reuters in London , "" Agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality , if there was full participation by producers and consumers , and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously ."" But Baron added , "" No real sanctions are available for a country that doesn ' t stick to its obligations ... The German approach is sceptical . We don ' t think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries . They were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them ."" Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements , reflecting its strong links with Third World producing countries . But recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for "" intellectual honesty "" and "" objective criteria "" have grown . British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid . It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open - ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact , they said . U . K . Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be . A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price realism in commodity pacts , adding high prices inflate supply . A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable to commodity pacts . France , a large consumer and producer of sugar , favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation , particularly regarding stocks . Indonesia ' s Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told Reuters in Jakarta : "" These agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclical .. But it ' s another matter when there are structural problems .. But we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith ."" Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements . "" The political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work ,"" Martinez Cuenca said . The head of the economics department in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry , Sebastiao do Rego Barros , told Reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market reality . If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system of quotas , with a link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices , it can work . UNCTAD spokesman Graham Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries ' ability to service debt and mean greater demand for industrialised nations ' capital goods ."

16,"CSR SELLS OIL / GAS INTERESTS , BIDS TO EXTEND SUGAR CSR Ltd has made a bold move in selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business , share analysts said . CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would instead sell them to Exxon Corp unit Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc for 985 mln dlrs . In a twin announcement CSR , already Australia ' s largest sugar refiner , made a 2 . 20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd . A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs , but in opting to sell outright CSR had given itself the cash to all but eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best - performing divisions of sugar and building products , analysts said . The Pioneer Sugar investment would give CSR by far the largest stake in Australia ' s 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country , they said . Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid , through which CSR would benefit from the bottoming out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices ."
17,"U . S . SUGARBEET PLANTINGS SEEN RISING IN 1987 Representatives of U . S . sugar grower organizations said they expect some increase the area planted to sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987 cane sugar crop also are good . Dave Carter , president of the U . S . beet sugar association , said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states , California and Michigan , while sowings could be down slightly in the largest producing state of Minnesota . Overall , Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in the midwest , and this coupled with increases in California would increase U . S . sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1 . 232 mln acres sown last year . USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U . S . sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report . The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowings is that returns from competing crops such as soybeans and grains are "" just awful ,"" said Carter . In the midwest , bankers are strongly encouraging farmers to plant sugarbeets because the U . S . sugar program offers a loan rate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers from beet processors are spread evenly over the growing season , said Luther Markwart , executive vice president of the American sugarbeet growers association . "" The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys ,"" Markwart said . In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking a contract with processors to plant beets , Markwart said . USDA ' s report today will not include any harvested area estimates for sugarcane , but representatives of Florida , Hawaii and Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good . Horis Godfrey , a consultant representing Florida and Texas cane growers , said Florida cane is off to a good start because for the first time in several years there was no winter freeze . Although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year , cane production may be up in Florida this year , he said . In Hawaii , area harvested may decline slightly this year , but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields , said Eiler Ravnholt , vice president of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association . The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more than the usual amount of attention this year because of mounting concern that continued increases in domestic sugar production threaten the U . S . sugar program , industry sources said . The increases in beet plantings have especially caused concern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings , particularly in Hawaii , industry officials said . "" We haven ' t had a good weather year throughout the beet and cane areas in more than five years ,"" said Godfrey , adding that the U . S . may be due for a good weather year . Rep . Jerry Huckaby , D - La ., chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee responsible for the sugar program , has threatened to offer legislation next year to curb domestic sweetener output if growers fail to restrain output in 1987 ."

Last week Beghin - Say president Jean - Marc Vernes said a possible settlement of a row with the EC would lead producers to withdraw their offer , which was made as a protest against EC export licensing policies . The EC policy is to offer export rebates , which fail to give producers an equivalent price to that which they would get by offering sugar into intervention stocks , Vernes said . But Minguzzi said the offer was a commercial affair and that producers had no intention of withdrawing the sugar offer already lodged with intervention boards of different European countries . He said final quality approval for all the sugar offered could come later this week . Some 95 pct had already cleared quality specifications . The EC can only reject an offer to sell into intervention stocks on quality grounds . Minguzzi added that under EC regulations , the Community has until early May to pay for the sugar .

29,"U . S . HOUSE PANEL EXTENDS EEP , URGES USSR OFFER The U . S . House Agriculture Committee approved proposals to extend the life of the Export Enhancement Program , EEP , through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reagan administration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union . The proposals were approved as amendments to a comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year . In addition to the amendments on EEP , the committee approved several proposals which could restrict imports of lamb , casein , sugar - containing products and tobacco . Those amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because the House Ways and Means Committee , which has overall jurisdiction over trade legislation , will oppose them , Congressional sources said . The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than the current three years through fiscal 1988 . The amendments , offered by Rep . Dan Glickman , D - Kan ., also would increase funding for the program to 2 . 5 billion dlrs from 1 . 5 billion now . Furthermore , the committee passed an amendment offered by Rep . Glickman which instructs the U . S . Agriculture Department to value EEP bonus commodities at market value , not acquisition value . Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct less expensive to operate . The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union , offered by Rep . Bob Smith , R - Ore ., does not require the administration make an offer , but urges such action . The committee approved an amendment , offered by Rep . Glenn English , D - Okla ., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to begin discussions with other major grain producing countries aimed at jointly reducing world grain production . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the amendment , saying such commodity agreements do not work . Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved by the panel , the most significant would require quotas on imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm product that is subject to U . S . quotas . The amendment , offered by Rep . Arlan Stangeland , R - Minn ., is aimed primarily at curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and foreign foods containing dairy products . It also may affect peanut , cotton and tobacco imports , Committee sources said . Another amendment would place a quota on U . S . imports of casein , a dairy product shipped to the U . S . primarily by New Zealand and Ireland . The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U . S . beef imports . Other miscellaneous amendments included : -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove restrictions on beef imports . -- Boosting the amount of U . S . grain which must be shipped each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to 800 , 000 tonnes from 500 , 000 tonnes now . -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to determine if it is a non - tariff trade barrier . -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the National Corn Growers Association up to 500 , 000 dlrs for the costs of defending the U . S . feedgrains program against a Canadian countervailing duty case this year . -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision to apply a duty on U .

32,"EC SUGAR TENDER SAID TO MARK NO CHANGE IN POLICY The maximum rebate granted at yesterday ' s European Community ( EC ) sugar tender marked no change in policy towards producers ' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the EC , EC commission sources said . They said this was despite the fact that the commission accepted over 785 , 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention yesterday from traders protesting that rebates are being set too low . The maximum rebate at yesterday ' s tender was 46 . 864 Ecus per 100 kilos , up from 45 . 678 Ecus the previous week . London traders said yesterday the rebate was the largest ever granted . The commission sources said today the increase was entirely explained by world market conditions . The amount by which the rebate fell short of what producers claim is needed to obtain an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention remained at 0 . 87 Ecus per 100 kilos , they said . Operators offered a total of 854 , 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention last month to protest at rebates which they said were too low . The sources said about 706 , 470 tonnes of French sugar and 79 , 000 tonnes of German sugar had been accepted , the remainder being rejected as of too low quality . The sources noted the operators could withdraw their offers in the five week period between the acceptance of the sugar and payment for it . They said they saw no sign of planned withdrawals as yet , adding that they would expect operators to wait another week or two to review commission policy before making up their minds . The sources said the commission felt entitled to offer rebates at slightly below the level theoretically justifiable in the light of its 1987 / 88 farm price package proposal to reduce guaranteed prices for sugar by two pct from the start of the new season in July ."

36,"RECENT SUGAR FALL SPARKS SOVIET , CHINESE BUYING The recent fall in world sugar prices , due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export availability , has encouraged renewed buying interest from China and the Soviet Union , London trade house E . D . And F . Man said . Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of China at the lower end of the recent price range , which should limit the downside movement , it said in its latest monthly market report . "" And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return to the market to take a further 250 , 000 / 350 , 000 tonnes for May / June shipment , Man added . The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April / May shipment towards the end of last month , which brings its total purchases to around 1 . 65 mln tonnes , Man said . Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2 . 3 mln tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2 . 5 mln tonnes . However , this upturn in the Thai crop is being countered by a reduction in China ' s production forecast to 5 . 3 mln tonnes from 5 . 5 mln estimated earlier . Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could be close to last year ' s 7 . 3 mln tonnes . But even with similar production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down . Cuba was reported to be carrying 1 . 3 mln tonnes of stocks in September 1985 , of which some 440 , 000 tonnes were used to boost its 1985 / 86 exports to about 6 . 9 mln . But as it will not be able to draw on surplus stocks this year , Man estimates Cuba ' s export availabilty will be reduced to 6 . 4 to 6 . 5 mln tonnes . However , Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters with reduced availability , Man said . Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes . But at the same time free market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount , which has left exporters chasing falling import requirements . A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged . But the difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still remains , as at least one more season of production deficit is needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still overhanging the market , Man said . The increasing cases of record production as a result of record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers to strive for greater efficiency . As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of production , sugar exporters may become more responsive to prices and in particular to upward price movements , Man said . Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and sugar producers , Man said despite the recent improvement in the level of restitutions , they are still insufficient to fully compensate producers when exporting on the world market . Unless there are further improvements , at least some sugar is expected to remain in intervention , it added ."
37,"BEGHIN - SAY NOT PLANNING TO WITHDRAW SUGAR French sugar producer Beghin - Say is not currently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed into intervention , despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded at this week ' s European Community ( EC ) sugar tender , Beghin - Say President Jean - Marc Vernes told Reuters . The maximum rebate of 46 . 864 Ecus per 100 kilos on Wednesday was the largest ever granted , according to traders . Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission has started to move in the right direction , but said his company had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into intervention . But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final agreement would be reached with the commission which would allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention . European operators offered 854 , 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention to protest about export rebates which they say are too low . Over 785 , 000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by the commission on Wednesday , according to commission sources . Under EC regulations , however , operators have another four to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before payment is made for it . A total of 706 , 470 tonnes of French sugar and 79 , 000 tonnes of West German sugar has been accepted into intervention , trade sources said here . This amount represents about a third of annual EC exports to non - EC countries . Beghin - Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it had offered into intervention , but said it was below 500 , 000 tonnes . Producers say they have been losing 2 . 5 to 3 . 0 Ecus on every 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fully bridge the gap between EC and world prices . Wednesday ' s rebate was 0 . 87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention , traders said . Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates to the full intervention price and said Wednesday ' s tender was a step in the right direction . Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised for export since the begining of the current campaign had been inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate . Trade sources said new regulations governing export rebates , which are due to be adopted shortly , may smooth the path for the commission to award larger export rebates in future . One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemed the commission had understood the protest action and was now moving towards adapting the situation accordingly , thereby allowing the operators to withdraw their sugar from intervention once they got satisfaction ."

41,"U . S . IMMIGRATION RULES SPARK CONGRESS OBJECTIONS New immigration rules relating to alien farm workers and reportedly being drafted by the U . S . Agriculture Department are meeting with objections in Congress , sources on Capitol Hill said . USDA is drafting regulations , required by a 1986 law , that would offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in the cultivation of fruits , vegetables and other perishable commodities . The department is considering including in its definition of perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco , hops , Spanish reeds and Christmas trees , while excluding sugar cane , the New York Times reported yesterday . Rep . Howard Berman , D - Calif ., would like to see the definition extended to include sugar cane , cultivation of which is "" a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation ,"" Gene Smith , a spokesman for Berman , said . Livestock , dairy and poultry producers have been lobbying USDA hard to have their products covered by the amnesty provision , farm industry sources said . Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation said livestock producers were "" desperate "" because they fear they will be unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joined that industry . A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986 immigration law who asked not to be identified said Congress did not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workers who helped cultivate tobacco , and that inclusion of hops and Spanish reeds was "" marginal ."" In addition , lawmakers made it clear during consideration of the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by the the amnesty provisions , making the inclusion of Christmas trees "" a tough call ,"" this source said . USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulation except to say it was subject to change before it will be released , probably some time later this month . While lawmakers may object to the USDA rule under consideration relating to perishable commodities , Congress is not likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigration question , congressional sources said . The amnesty provision specially designed for farm workers was crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill . Congressional staff members estimate the special farm worker amnesty provision would apply to between 250 , 000 to 350 , 000 aliens . The law would allow eligible farm workers who worked for 90 days during the year ending May 1 , 1986 , to apply for temporary , then permanent , resident status ."

55,"INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW Indonesia "" s agriculture sector will grow by just 1 . 0 pct in calendar 1987 , against an estimated 2 . 4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines , the U . S . Embassy said in a report . Production of Indonesia "" s staple food , rice , is forecast to fall to around 26 . 3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26 . 58 mln tonnes in 1986 , according to the annual report on Indonesia "" s agricultural performance . The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26 . 7 mln tonnes , with a forecast 27 . 3 mln tonnes output in 1987 . The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1 . 5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1 . 69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks . "" Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane , rubber and copra show little or no gain ,"" the report says . "" The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans , palm oil and palm kernels ."" Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds , limited fertile land , insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops , the report underlines . The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as "" wereng "" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields . The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties , and to use lower - yielding , more resistant rice types . The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee , tea , rubber , plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices . Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7 . 0 pct in 1987 to 1 . 45 mln tonnes from 1 . 35 mln , with exports rising to an estimated 720 , 000 tonnes from 695 , 000 tonnes in 1986 , the report says . But while production of soybeans in 1987 / 88 ( Oct - Sept ) will rise to 1 . 075 mln tonnes from 980 , 000 in 1986 / 87 , imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant . The report says that imports of wheat , soybeans , soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September "" s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand . The report said that Indonesia "" s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate , the lowest rate of growth since the mid - 1960s . It compares with 1 . 9 pct growth in 1985 and 6 . 7 pct in 1984 . The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump ."
56,"AUSTRALIA ATTACKS U . S . GATT FARM RULES EXEMPTION Australia accused the U . S . of increasing protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to Washington ' s special 32 - year exemption from certain GATT rules on agricultural trade . Robert Arnott , Australia ' s delegate to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ), made the appeal at a special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U . S . waiver . "" Australia today said the United States ' goals of reducing U . S . barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by actions which in fact increased protection in trade in agriculture ,"" the Australian delegation said in a statement . "" The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture ,"" Arnott told the meeting . Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a justification for "" dubious protective measures "" by the U . S . He listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to close the U . S . sugar market to imports . He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic support programs . This covered imports of dairy products , peanuts , cotton and sugar . Asked to comment , Michael Samuels , U . S . ambassador to the GATT , told Reuters : "" These charges have been made since the very beginning . The waiver is part of domestic U . S . agricultural policy , part of our law when we joined the GATT "". "" We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with their programs . We can negotiate them all ,"" Samuels added .

57,"CUBAN CATTLE THREATENED BY DROUGHT Over 750 , 000 head of cattle are suffering the effects of a severe shortage of feed as a result of a prolonged drought in the normally rich sugar and cattle producing province of Camaguey , the newspaper Granma reported . The province produces 23 pct of Cuba ' s beef and is the island ' s number two province in milk production . Granma said 20 , 000 head of cattle are now in imminent danger . The newspaper said a "" cattle emergency "" had been decreed and the cattle are being rounded up . Some 110 , 000 head have been transferred to the sugar cane conditioning centers where newly harvested cane is cleaned before being sent to the mills . The cattle are being fed the residue left after cleaning the cane stalks . 32 , 000 head have been sent to nearby provinces of Las Tunas and Ciego de Avila .

58,"BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS Brazil ' s recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987 . The developing world ' s most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans , and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets , economists said . "" That sounds like a reasonable strategy . But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation ,"" Aldo Roldan , Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics , said . Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets , but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable . "" Domestic costs have increased ( due to inflation ) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates ,"" Roldan said . The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil , where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs . But he added : "" They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels ."" Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee , and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world ' s largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance . Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) members to re - establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence . "" Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations , which others wanted changed ,"" one senior coffee dealer said . The dealer , who declined to be named , said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share . At the end of the talks , he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer . Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales , the dealer said . "" If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar , ninety or eighty cents ,"" he said . New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2 . 29 cents lower Thursday at 104 . 68 cents a lb , while more distant deliveries fell the six - cent maximum trading limit . President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute , Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas . Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped - up Brazilian marketing efforts . "" They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been ,"" according to Richard Loewy , analyst for Prudential - Bache Securities Inc . Loewy believes the foreign debt problem , a good crop , plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop . "" Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can ' t afford to store the crops ,"" he said . The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields . "" We are going to see a very rapid decline , earlier than usual , this year in our ( U . S .) exports ,"" Loewy said . Tommy Eshleman , economist for the American Soybean Association ( ASA ), said this year ' s Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes , versus 13 . 7 mln last year . Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the U . S . crop to bad growing weather . Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the U . S . government soybean loan rate , offered to farmers who give crops as collateral , Eshleman said . He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate , which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market . Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan . "" We ' re getting into a period when they ( Brazil ) are starting to harvest and starting to export ,"" Eshleman said . But he added it will be a while before U . S . exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently . Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation . He said the debt situation was a major consideration . "" The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage ,"" he added . Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops , Melicias said it would not make a big difference . On other commodity markets , Brazil ' s selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital . Brazil is faced with a poor 1986 / 87 sugar harvest , which could limit exports to the world market , analysts said . The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments , and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar , will give it little room to stretch exports , they said . Brazil ' s other major crop , cocoa , is in its third year of surplus . "" Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell , so I don ' t think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it ,"" one analyst said . "" If they come out as aggressive sellers , the market would collapse and they can ' t afford to do that ,"" she added ."
59,"INDONESIAN SUGAR OUTPUT SEEN SHORT OF TARGET Indonesia ' s raw sugar output is likely to be 1 . 8 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 , unchanged from 1986 and below the government ' s 1987 forecast of 2 . 5 mln , the U . S . Embassy said in its agricultural outlook for 1987 . Indonesia bought 162 , 500 tonnes of raw sugar on world markets in late 1986 , the report said . The embassy estimated Indonesia ' s calendar 1986 raw sugar production at 1 . 8 mln tonnes , against a government estimate of 1 . 99 mln . It said that Indonesia ' s move into sugar self - sufficiency in 1984 may have been short - lived . The report said , "" The government continues to promote sugarcane production through its smallholder intensification program and a relatively high guaranteed price to sugarcane producers . "" However , there are considerable indications that farmers are reluctant to plant cane because its economic return is not as good as that of other crops ."""

78,"GERMAN SUGAR OFFERS PUT AT ABOUT 100 , 000 TONNES The West German intervention board said about 100 , 000 tonnes of sugar have been offered into intervention so far . A spokesman , speaking from Frankfurt , told Reuters offers have increased recently but contracts have not yet been concluded . A European Commission spokesman in Brussels earlier confirmed that one mln tonnes of sugar had been offered to intervention boards in various member states . The intervention board spokesman in Frankfurt said , "" One million tonnes is an awful lot and the Community ' s coffers are almost empty . This could turn into a serious political problem ."" West German trade sources said they believed the one mln tonne offer by the EC sugar industry into intervention would have a neutral market impact overall ."
79,"LICHT SEES STAGNANT EUROPEAN BEET AREA The overall area devoted to sugar beet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7 . 22 mln hectares compared with 7 . 21 mln ha in 1986 , West German statistician F . O . Licht said . It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year , Licht said , but judging by this first estimate the effect was probably minimal . The total beet area in the European Community is forecast to fall two pct to 1 . 85 mln ha against 1 . 89 mln in 1986 . The total Western Europe area is put at 2 . 49 mln ha , against 2 . 50 mln in 1986 . Eastern Europe area is forecast at 4 . 73 mln ha against 4 . 72 mln . Individual West Europe country estimates , in 1 , 000 hectares ( with 1986 figures in brackets ), are , Belgium / Luxembourg 114 ( 118 ), Denmark 69 ( 69 ), France 419 ( 421 ), Greece 35 ( 44 ), Ireland 36 ( 38 ), Italy 270 ( 275 ), Netherlands 129 ( 138 ), Portugal 1 ( 1 ), Spain 192 ( 190 ), U .

Eastern Europe plantings are forecast as follows , USSR 3400 ( 3440 ), Albania 10 ( 9 ), Bulgaria 52 ( 50 ), Czechoslovakia 195 ( 196 ), East Germany 210 ( 205 ), Hungary 108 ( 96 ), Poland 460 ( 440 ), Romania 295 ( 280 ). On the basis of average yields this year , Licht said these area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in 1987 / 88 of 29 . 8 mln tonnes , raw value , down from 31 . 4 mln tonnes in 1986 / 87 . Licht said sugar yields were fairly high last season , thanks to favourable weather , and this increases the chances of a significant reduction in production in 1987 / 88 . Based on average yields , EC beet sugar production could fall nearly 10 pct this year to 13 . 5 mln tonnes from 14 . 9 mln in 1986 / 87 , while total Western Europe production could be 16 . 9 mln tonnes against 18 . 1 mln . Eastern Europe production could be 12 . 9 mln tonnes against 13 . 3 mln in 1986 / 87 ."
80,"EC COMMISSION REJECTS SUGAR THREATS - SOURCES The European Community Commission has told EC member states that it is not prepared to discuss EC sugar prices while sugar traders threaten to make a huge sale into intervention stocks to protest against its policies , Commission sources said . "" Our position is that we are not willing to discuss the problems of market prices at a time when traders are making threats ,"" one source said . The sources said the Commission ' s view was made clear at a meeting of its sugar management committee today . They said French , West German and Dutch officials had informed the committee that traders in their countries intended to sell just over 850 , 000 tonnes of sugar into EC intervention stocks . The Commission riposted by signalling that it would sell the sugar sold into intervention back onto the EC market by tender , a move that would push down prices .

Diplomats said this reflected Hungary ' s policy of keeping the sugar beet area stable under the current five - year plan ( 1985 - 89 ) and producing enough to cover only domestic demand despite the recent rise of world prices to 10 month highs . Drought cut the 1986 harvest to 3 . 58 mln tonnes from 4 . 07 mln in 1985 .

86,"CHINA FACES DILEMMA OVER SUGAR IMPORTS China has to decide if it will increase sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and rising demand , in view of market predictions that international sugar prices will remain firm this year , traders and the official press said . He Kang , Minister of Agriculture , Animal Husbandry and Fisheries , said this week that China has adjusted the purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in production last year but he gave no price details . One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly because of improving living standards and rising demand for sweet drinks , cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods . "" It will not be easy to cut domestic demand , even in a state - controlled economy . China may have to import ,"" he said . Customs figures show imports fell to 1 . 182 mln tonnes in 1986 from 1 . 909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25 , 165 tonnes in January 1987 from 54 , 000 in January 1986 . The official Economic Information newspaper last month said production in the 1986 / 87 crushing season ( September - April ) will be 1 . 18 mln tonnes short of demand . The paper put 1986 / 87 output at 4 . 82 mln , down from 5 . 24 mln in 1985 / 86 , and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes . "" In the last two years , acreage under sugar cane and beet has fallen , sugar mills are underutilised , output has dropped and cannot meet demand that is rising every day ,"" it said . "" The country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw down stocks to meet market demand ,"" it added . It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming the drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane and beet as against other crops , which has resulted in farmers refusing to grow them . The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane . He could sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne , against only 70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane . Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have not changed for 20 years despite rising costs , it said . In Fujian , the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan in 1985 from 520 . 1 in 1980 , cutting the mills ' profit to 117 yuan a tonne from 217 . 9 , it added . The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the 442 sugar mills working in the 1985 / 86 crushing season losing money . China has 521 sugar mills . A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane acreage in 1986 / 87 ( September - August ) of up to 10 pct in Guangdong , which produced 45 pct of China ' s sugar in calendar 1985 , and a smaller drop in Fujian , which produced 11 pct of China ' s sugar in calendar 1985 . He said both provinces are more developed than other sugar - producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities . But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan , which accounted for 28 pct of the 1985 crop , has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986 / 87 , because cane - growing is more economic there , he said . He put sugar stocks at 2 . 333 mln tonnes in September 1986 . A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln at end - January . "" Now they are falling but ( they ) have not reached the critical level , compelling China to import quickly ,"" he said . "" China has options not easily available in western countries . It controls stocks strictly and can release less into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly ,"" he said . The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be slightly less than those of 1986 , because of firm world prices and serious foreign exchange constraints which , he said , are likely to continue until at least end - 1988 . He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state - owned mills , with a small amount sold raw to consumers . "" Most of the mills are old and inefficient , with many of them using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s ,"" he said . He said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annual four pct , with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct ."
87,"CUBA SUGAR CROP SEEN AT LEAST SAME AS LAST YEAR Cuban sugar export figures for January suggest that this year ' s crop may be at least as large as last year ' s 7 . 35 mln tonnes , according to sugar analysts . Exports in January totalled 733 , 000 tonnes raw value , up from 725 , 000 a year earlier , according to figures received by the International Sugar Organization . January is the first major export month and the figures thus give a good indication of the current crop , they said . Fourth quarter exports fell to 622 , 000 tonnes from 909 , 000 tonnes a year earlier , but this was because Cuba was destocking at the end of 1985 , they added . Trade house C Czarnikow recently estimated production this year at 7 . 50 mln tonnes . Cuban sugar production in the third quarter of 1986 was 12 , 000 tonnes , giving a final 1985 / 86 crop total of 7 . 35 mln tonnes , compared with a 1984 / 85 crop of 8 . 10 mln tonnes . There is normally no third quarter production in Cuba , but a hurricane meant that last year ' s crop was extended . Exports to the USSR were substantially down in January at 362 , 000 tonnes from 489 , 000 in January 1986 , but other Comecon countries received 210 , 000 tonnes , against 80 , 000 tonnes in the same month last year , figures received by the ISO show . Bulgaria , Czechoslovakia , Poland and Romania all took substantially more Cuban sugar . Cuba ' s November 1986 exports totalled 158 , 000 tonnes , compared with 190 , 000 tonnes in 1985 , and December ' s total was 237 , 000 tonnes , down from 518 , 000 tonnes the year before . Calendar year exports for 1986 were also lower at 6 . 69 mln tonnes against 7 . 21 mln in 1985 -- the lowest level since 1980 ' s 6 . 19 mln tonnes , the figures show ."
88,"LOW SUGAR PRICES MAY ATTRACT SOVIET / CHINESE Any further decline in raw sugar prices is likely to attract buying from the Soviet Union and China , Woodhouse , Drake and Carey said in their latest weekly market report .

89,"NO TAIWAN SUGAR EXPORTS EXPECTED THIS YEAR Taiwan is not expected to export sugar this year because of falling production and growing domestic consumption , state - owned Taiwan Sugar Corp said . A company spokesman told Reuters this will be the first time in more than 40 years Taiwan has not exported sugar . Last year , sugar exports totalled 149 , 755 tonnes . He said the actual production during the 1986 / 87 season ( November / May ) is about 480 , 000 tonnes , barely enough to meet local consumption . This compares with actual 1985 / 86 output of 570 , 000 . He said the production fall was due to typhoon damage to more than 6 , 000 hectares of canefields last year ."
90,"EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED European sugar beet plantings are expected to show little change from last year , despite recent firmness in world prices , analysts and industry sources said . A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while , so far , European Community ( EC ) growers plan unchanged to lower areas , increases are expected in some Eastern European nations . Trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West German sugar statistician F . O . Licht . Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this . In recent years , good autumn weather has given yields a late boost , making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons . Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so - called "" C "" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market . This is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the EC "" A "" and "" B "" quotas , which receive full and partial price support , respectively . Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output . Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices . However , with the EC budget stretched to breaking point , this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic "" A "" and "" B "" quotas , they added . In France , the largest producer of EC quota and non quota sugar , the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year ' s 421 , 000 hectares , nine pct below the previous year . "" The basic trend is towards stability ,"" a FIRS spokesman said . Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars , white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels , he said . Beet sugar output last year was 3 . 37 mln tonnes , with an average yield of 8 . 00 tonnes per ha , the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands but below 8 . 52 the previous year and a five year average 8 . 11 . In West Germany , recent price rises have not altered plans , since planting decisions were taken a few months ago , industry sources said . The farm ministry said a December survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average . Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a reduced 385 , 000 hectares against 399 , 000 last year . British Sugar Plc , the monopoly beet processor , has signed up U . K . Farmers to grow 8 . 1 mln tonnes of beet . This should yield about 1 . 25 mln tonnes of whites . Last year ' s crop equalled the second highest ever at 1 . 32 mln tonnes . British Sugar has "" A "" and "" B "" quotas totalling 1 . 144 mln tonnes of whites and its "" C "" output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease - resistant seed types . Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans , Wincenty Nowicki , a deputy director of Cukropol , the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises , said . World prices are still below Polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level . The national plan , set before prices began to rise , put plantings this year at 460 , 000 hectares , against 425 , 000 in 1986 , Nowicki said . Last year production was 1 . 74 mln tonnes . World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market , an official at the national beet growers ' association said . Italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last year ' s 270 , 000 ha , especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya . Beet output last season of 15 . 5 mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected 1 . 72 mln tonnes of white sugar . Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130 , 000 ha from a record 137 , 600 in 1986 as a new self - imposed quota system comes into force , a spokesman for Centrale Suiker , the second largest Dutch sugar processor , said . The new system aims for an average of around 915 , 000 tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of "" C "" sugar . Last year , the Netherlands produced a record 1 . 2 mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined "" A "" and "" B "" quota of only 872 , 000 tonnes . "" The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of "" C "" sugar really worthwhile ,"" the spokesman said . Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged . Licht put this year ' s Soviet beet area at 3 . 40 mln ha , against 3 . 44 mln last year . Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105 , 000 ha from some 95 , 000 in 1986 , the official MTI news agency said , but diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic demand . The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are estimated unchanged at 180 , 000 ha this year . A spokesman for Denmark ' s largest beet concern , De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A / S , said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged from 1986 at 365 , 000 tonnes from a steady area of 60 , 000 ha . In Sweden , where beet is grown just to meet domestic demand , the planted area is seen little changed at 51 , 000 ha against 51 , 300 last year , according to a spokesman for sugar company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB . Last year , Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to late sowings and the state - run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987 plantings target is the equivalent of 36 , 400 hectares , down from 37 , 600 in 1986 ."
91,"INDONESIAN SUGAR OUTPUT FORECAST TO RISE IN 1987 Indonesian sugar output is forecast by the government to reach 2 . 126 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 against projected consumption of 2 . 039 mln tonnes , Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi said . Production in 1986 , when Indonesia was forced to import sugar , is officially estimated at 2 . 016 mln tonnes against 1 . 728 mln in 1985 . The U . S . Embassy said in its annual Agriculture Report on Indonesia there were growing signs that actual output was lower than official figures . It estimated 1986 production at 1 . 8 mln tonnes and forecast little change for 1987 . Indonesia imported 162 , 000 tonnes of sugar towards the end of last year and in early 1987 to boost low stocks . Affandi told reporters stocks fel to as low as 159 , 000 tonnes at the beginning of 1987 . Industry sources said this represented under one month ' s consumption . The minister said Indonesia should hold three months ' supply , or 510 , 000 tonnes .

94,"SUGAR PRICES TOO LOW TO BOOST LATIN OUTPUT Latin American sugar producers are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving to boost production , official and trade sources said . Although prices have risen to around eight from five U . S . Cents per lb in the past six months , they are still below the region ' s nine to ten cents per lb average production cost . The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the alert , Manuel Rico , a consultant with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries ( GEPLACEA ), told Reuters . However , Rico said , it would require another five to seven cents to stimulate notable increases in output . "" Producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable ,"" he said . Officials in Mexico , Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued rise in prices would stimulate production , but industry leaders in Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go . "" The prices are ridiculous ,"" said Julian Mateo , vice president of Costa Rica ' s Sugar Cane Industrial - Agricultural League . "" At current prices nobody is going to consider increasing production ."" Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing output , given the instability of world markets . An official at Colombia ' s National Association of Sugar Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets . "" The market is very unstable . What is happening is not yet giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify anything ."" In 1985 , the latest year for which full figures are available , Central and South American nations produced 28 mln tonnes , raw value , of sugar of which 12 . 3 mln were exported . A year earlier , they had produced and exported about 800 , 000 more , according to the London - based International Sugar Organization . Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover . Miguel Guerrero , director of the Dominican Republic ' s National Sugar Institute , said it would be difficult to boost production even if prices recovered sharply . Output had slumped to under 450 , 000 tonnes a year from 900 , 000 in the late 1970s . Obsolete refineries , poor transport and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short term recovery in output , he added . Plans of nearby Cuba , the world ' s largest cane sugar exporter , to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious , trade sources said . Output is running well below the record 8 . 6 mln produced in 1970 . Cuba suffers from run down plantations , harvesting problems and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices , since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries under special deals . Last year , bad weather added to its troubles , and output fell to 7 . 2 mln tonnes from 8 . 2 mln in 1985 . The low world prices of recent years have led many countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels where they barely cover U . S . And , in the case of some Caribbean countries , European Community ( EC ) import quotas , for which they receive prices well above free market levels . Progressive reductions in the U . S . Quotas have led to production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to the free world market . Peru , for example , shipped 96 , 000 tonnes to the U . S . In both 1983 and 1984 . This fell to 76 , 000 in 1986 and this year its quota is only 37 , 000 . A national cooperative official said that , as long as world market levels continue at around half of Peru ' s production cost , the future of the industry is uncertain . At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane which , according to the group ' s executive - secretary Eduardo Latorre , "" grows like a weed "" throughout the region . Brazil , the largest cane producer with output of around 240 mln tonnes , uses over half to produce alcohol fuel . Cane in excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency . The difference in the price the state - run Sugar and Alcohol Institute ( IAA ) pays local industry and what it receives from foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year . Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the past year , coupled with a drought - reduced cane crop , has meant Brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in 1987 , trade sources said . Negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far , the main sticking point being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non - delivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace . Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year , with the Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild depleted reserve stockpiles . However , the situation could change dramatically if the economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps . Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little hope for the region ' s sugar industry to return to profitability unless the U . S . And EC change their policies . "" The agricultural policies of the European Community and of the United States have caused our economies incalculable harm by closing their markets , by price deterioration in international commerce and furthermore by the unfair competition in third countries ,"" Brazil ' s Trade and Industry Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA meeting . The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess output on world markets . GEPLACEA officials say this is the main cause of low prices . GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the region ' s industry out of steady decline . Such an agreement would have to have both U . S . And EC backing and industrialised countries would have to see it as a political rather than a merely economic pact . "" They have to realise that the more our economies suffer , the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the region ' s 360 billion dollar foreign debt ,"" GEPLACEA ' s Latorre said ."
95,"CUBA TELLS TRADERS SUGAR EXPORTS MAY BE DELAYED Cuba has told international sugar operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that these contracts will take second place to Cuba ' s direct shipments to its export markets , dealers here said . Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the language of the message was not totally clear and some believed shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet Union as the destination of their contracts . The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last week and reflect a poor Cuban crop , worry over Brazil ' s export availability , and increasing Soviet demand , analysts said . Traders said signs of Cuba ' s shortage of immediately available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender last month . Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward delivery , and last month ' s spot requirement resulted in the sale of several cargoes . Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export markets , traders said ."

97,"CUBAN SUGAR OUTPUT SEEN AT 7 . 5 MLN TONNES Cuban sugar output this season ( 1986 / 87 ) is put at around 7 . 5 mln tonnes raw value by broker C . Czarnikow in its monthly sugar market review . Allowing for around 700 , 000 tonnes for the current year ' s domestic usage it would leave around 6 . 8 mln tonnes for export of which , Czarnikow estimates , about 3 . 7 mln tonnes will be taken by the USSR , 1 . 530 mln by other socialist countries and the remainder for delivery to non - socialist bloc destinations . Czarnikow also estimated USSR 1986 / 87 production at 8 . 75 mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3 . 7 mln imports from Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export needs of 14 . 2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1 . 75 mln tonnes to be acquired from the world market . Soviet purchases to date may not be far short of that quantity , Czarnikow said ."
98,"EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN AS CONCESSION TO PRODUCERS The rebate granted at yesterday ' s EC sugar tender represents some concession to producers ' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the bloc , EC Commission officials said . The maximum rebate of 44 . 819 European currency units ( Ecus ) per 100 kilos was 1 . 3 Ecus below what producers say is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into intervention . The rebate at last week ' s tender was 2 . 5 Ecus per 100 kilos short of the level producers said was needed , the officials said . The officials said the Commission is not negotiating with producers who have offered a total of 854 , 000 tonnes of sugar for sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade it to offer higher rebates . They said the French and German producers involved are now unable to withdraw this offer before April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores . Payment for it is due five weeks later , and it will be open to them to withdraw their offers at any time between April 1 and the official payment date when the Commission officially takes ownership of the sugar , the officials said . The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar , it is determined to immediately resell it , a move which would drive down market prices further . They expressed some hope that the operators would not eventually go through with their plan for intervention sales . "" We think they realise they have gone too far ,"" one official said ."
99,"EC MAY OFFER INTERVENTION SUGAR TO LOCAL MARKET Sugar which EC producers plan to sell into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for sale within the Community , broker C . Czarnikow says in its latest sugar review . The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very nominal premium of 0 . 01 European Currency Unit ( Ecu ) to the intervention price , with detrimental consequences for producers ' returns , Czarnikow says . The move is seen as an attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered sugar . The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade producers from their chosen course , such as removing the time limit on storage contracts , which presently means that intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September , Czarnikow says . There is also the possibility of production quotas being reduced . If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for export , the restitutions would have to be higher than those at recent export tenders , Czarnikow notes . To match the difference between the EC price and the world market price , the extra costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne , it says . The producers might have to repay these costs through production levies and the proposed special elimination levy , Czarnikow says , but it would be several months before any costs could be recovered under EC rules . The primary cause of the plan to sell 775 , 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price , Czarnikow notes . The French move is thus seen as a form of protest designed to force the Commission ' s hand . In West Germany , 79 , 250 tonnes have been tendered for intervention , but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure that the 1986 / 87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in 1986 . In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price , West German producers face a further price reduction in July with a probable revaluation of the "" green "" mark . Even if the immediate crisis is resolved , the problem is not expected to disappear permanently . It has appeared to traders for some years that the EC ' s export policy is insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand , it says . The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded , Czarnikow says , suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut down the amount of "" unnecessary bureaucracy "" surrounding the export tender system ."
100,"COSTA RICA SELLS SUGAR TO SOVIET UNION Costa Rica has agreed to sell more than 32 , 000 tonnes of sugar this year to the Soviet Union , a spokesman for local producers said . Miguel Alfaro , president of the agricultural league of the sugar cane industry , said the sale follows a recent 50 pct cut in Costa Rica ' s quota for sugar exports to the U . S . Alfaro said up to 45 , 000 tonnes of sugar could be exported to the Soviet Union this year under the deal , which is similar to one the Soviets made recently with the Dominican Republic . A Soviet ship will load 25 , 000 tonnes at the Pacific port of Punta Morales Monday , Alfaro said , and a second ship will take an additional 7 , 107 tonnes two days later . Alfaro and other industry sources declined to disclose the price at which the sugar was sold ."

Previous ISO chief William Miller retired at end - February last year . Ricart told Reuters his first aim is put the "" house in order "" by having a new administrative sugar pact with improved allocations of voting rights and financial contributions . Once this is done , time can be dedicated to working towards a new International Sugar Agreement ( ISA ) with economic clauses , he said . Ricart , currently the Dominican Republic ' s ambassador to Austria , the Netherlands and the UN in Geneva , said he will visit the four major exporters - Australia , Brazil , Cuba and the European Community - to talk to governments and producers and find out about problems that are preventing these countries finding common ground for a new sugar pact ."
102,"INTERNATIONAL SUGAR PACT TO BE RENEGOTIATED The International Sugar Agreement ( ISA ) will be renegotiated , International Sugar Organization ( ISO ) officer in charge Constantin Politoff told Reuters after a special session of the pact ' s council . A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISO six monthly session in May . The alternatives are between an autumn London conference for another pact without economic clauses , but a different voting and budgetary structure , or a Geneva - based conference next year for a new pact with economic clauses , he said . But delegates said the latter would only be considered if the world ' s four major exporters -- Australia , Brazil , Cuba and the European Community -- can resolve differences over how prices can best be supported and how to share the world Today ' s special session was called because the U . S . earlier indicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of the ISO budget . At today ' s council session Politoff said the U . S . would try and find a way to pay the balance of about 50 , 000 stg later this year . Currently , about three quarters of this year ' s ISO 800 , 000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the U . S . caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full contribution in the last year of the current pact . The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISO budget is shared out . Currently it is halved between importers and exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of the importer half . The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a single category of members who would all share the costs pro rata to their share of world sugar trade . The ISO executive committee next meets on April 23 with the next full council session in the week of May 19 . There are 12 importing and 44 exporting members of the ISO ."
103,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN DROUGHTS Three geographically diverse droughts in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a reintensification of the complex and little - understood El Nino weather pattern , & lt ; Accu - Weather Inc >, a commercial weather forecasting service , said . Rice and wheat farmers in China , wheat and sugarcane growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive in time to break the droughts , offical reports , government officials and meteorologists said . Wen Wei Po , a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links , said the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months . Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces , it added . Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan was 70 pct below average during February , the lowest figure for over 20 years , the paper said . The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many rivers , it added . This has resulted in reduced hydro - electric power , causing shortages to industry and households . The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century , causing many ships to run aground , Wen Wei Po said . Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across China , media reports said . The People ' s Daily said Sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average since early February . The New China News Agency said the average December temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984 . Severe drought is affecting about one - third of Sri Lanka and threatens to reduce the country ' s tea crop , Ministry of Plantation Industries officials told Reuters In Australia , concern is growing about below - average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the Queensland coast and in Western Australia ' s wheat belt , local Meteorological Bureau officials said . For many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major threat , the prospect of a dry autumn / winter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does , they added . Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982 / 83 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as El Nino , they said . Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the Asia - Pacific region ' s disrupted weather patterns to any single cause , El Nino ' s role is being closely studied , they said . Accu - Weather Inc , which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests , said each El Nino ' event ' was unique . The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last major event in 1982 / 83 , it said . El Nino , Spanish for "" Christ Child "" because it appears around Christmas , is formed by the action of warm air , bearing clouds and rain , shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast of Peru , where it mingles with the cold waters associated with the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade winds , meteorologists said . The winds , strengthened by El Nino ' s "" pump "" effect , raise the sea level off Australia and Indonesia , they said . When the winds drop , the ocean , seeking equilibrium , sends a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it collides with the cold seas off Peru , they said . One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the rain - bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the Pacific , where they further disrupt other weather patterns . The prospects for an end to the droughts vary , Accu - Weather said . China , where the affected areas have received between 40 and 75 pct of normal rainfall , will have to wait for the May - September rains , it said . The May - September rains normally provide the drought - striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall . In Australia , areas of Queensland ' s coastal strip have received less than half the normal rainfall during the current wet season , but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end . In Sri Lanka , the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year . The year ' s secondary rains usually occur between April and June , although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual ."

105,"U . S . SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA The U . S . Agriculture Department formally transmitted to Congress a long - awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments . In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying the "" Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987 "", Peter Myers , Deputy Agriculture Secretary , said the Reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop , down from 18 cts now . Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991 . The payments would cost an estimated 1 . 1 billion dlrs , Myers said . The administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep . John Porter , R - Ill . Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because politically - influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist . The direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years . It also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20 , 000 short tons raw sugar per grower . For example , on the first 350 tons of production , a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988 , 4 . 5 cts in 1989 , 3 cts in 1990 and 1 . 5 cts in 1991 . The income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years , whichever is less , USDA said . Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry . He said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads . U . S . sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a "" progressive contraction "" of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year , he said . This has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing . Furthermore , USDA said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar - containing products a competitive advantage . The result has been higher imports of sugar - containing products and a flight of U . S . processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar . USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on U . S . consumers and industrial users . In fiscal 1987 , USDA said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar . "" Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing ,"" Myers said . The following table lists the rate of payments , in cts per lb , to growers and the quantity covered , in short tons recoverable raw sugar , under the administration ' s proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments .

106,"BEGHIN - SAY SEES SOLUTION TO EC SUGAR DISPUTE A settlement could soon be reached in the dispute between European sugar producers and the European Community over EC export licencing policies , Jean - Marc Vernes , president of French sugar producer Beghin - Say , which is leading the protest , told journalists today . "" Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days indicate that we are moving towards a solution ,"" he said , adding that if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854 , 000 tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention . Vernes said that the protest , involving 770 , 000 tonnes of sugar from French producers alone , was prompted by the EC ' s policy since mid - 1986 of offering export rebates which failed to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain by offering sugar into EC intervention . At last week ' s tender the EC Commission made an apparent concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1 . 3 European currency units ( Ecus ) per 100 kilos below the level producers say is needed , compared with the previous week ' s rebate which was 2 . 5 Ecus below the necessary level . Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the producers and the EC would take , but he reaffirmed the long - term desire of producers to export to the world market , providing they were not losing money by doing so . Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April 1 , when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores , or at any time over the following five weeks before the official payment date . The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers ."

This is above the 50 mln Ecu ( 57 mln dlr ) ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers . However , commission sources said the real cost was small if account is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until its quality and value deteriorates .

112,"U . S . SUGAR QUOTA MAY BE EASED , CONGRESSMAN SAYS The United States may soon ease its 1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringing forward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1987 , Jerry Huckaby , a leading Congressman representing sugar growers told Reuters in an interview . Huckaby , a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the House subcommittee which deals with the sugar program , indicated the easing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern about the impact of the severe cut in U . S . sugar imports this year . "" With imports coming down from 1 . 8 mln ( last year ) to one mln , there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbean countries and the Philippines ,"" Huckaby said . By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports , the quota would effectively be eased by about 250 , 000 tons . Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the third quarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the September to December period "" we could get away without having to increase the quota ."" He noted that some in the sugar industry believe an increase in the quota is justified . Earlier this month , representatives of U . S . cane sugar refiners met with U . S . Agriculture Department officials to request a quota increase of at least 200 , 000 tons . The refiners said the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictive there could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U . S later this year , a refiner spokesman said . However , the official slaid the USDA replied only that it would consider the request . Following the refiners ' request , representatives of the Florida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express opposition to any quota expansion , industry sources said . The statement by Huckaby , who as a representative from a sugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect of the current sugar program , indicates at least some grower officials are concerned enough to support an easing of the import quota , industry officials said . Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by the Reagan administration ' s interagency sugar policy group . Asked about possible quota changes , A USDA official said "" As far as I know , changing the quota volume or the quota year is not under active consideration ."""

114,"SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT TO STOP IMPORTING SUGAR The Food Department will no longer import sugar from April 1 , senior officials of the Food and Cooperatives Ministry and the Department told Reuters . They said the decision was taken after the Sugar Importers Association asked that the sugar trade be further liberalised . "" The Food Department will cease trading in sugar and will no longer hold a buffer stock ,"" a senior official said . He said the government has finalised an agreement with E . D . F .

The Department and the private sector each imported around 115 , 000 tonnes of sugar last year , when national consumption was 280 , 000 tonnes . An Importers Association official said that "" even if the Department no longer imports sugar , we would not necessarily buy more .""

121,"THAI SUGAR PRODUCTION CONTINUES HIGH IN FEB Thai sugar production continued at a high level in February , latest figures received by the International Sugar Organization ( ISO ) show . The figures show stocks at end - February of 2 . 49 mln tonnes raw value against 2 . 33 mln a year earlier . Analysts said this was a new peak for the date . Production in February was 961 , 000 tonnes against 888 , 000 in February 1986 and took the Nov / Feb total for the current crop to 2 . 25 mln tonnes . Production normally tails off sharply after March , but in recent years production from March to the end of the crop has been over 500 , 000 tonnes , analysts said . Thailand ' s exports in February were 32 , 800 tonnes and consumption 57 , 800 .

123,"U . S . SUGAR POLICY MAY SELF - DESTRUCT , CONGRESSMAN A leading U . S . farm - state Congressman , Jerry Huckaby , D - La ., warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners , perhaps including corn sweeteners , if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year . "" We ' re moving toward a direction where we could self - destruct ( the U . S . sugar program ),"" Rep . Huckaby , chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues , told Reuters in an interview . Huckaby , who told U . S . sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases , said he will deliver the same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday . He also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject . Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota , now at one mln short tons . "" I think if we ' re talking about dropping ( the quota ) another half mln tons , lets say , you ' re getting to the point where the program might not work ,"" he said . "" Ideally , I ' d like to freeze things right where we are ,"" said Huckaby , leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress . A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of 6 . 5 mln tons , the corn sweetener share of the U . S . market staying at just over 50 pct , and U . S sugar imports holding at about 1 . 2 mln tons , Huckaby said . A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year , he said . "" I feel like if we didn ' t expand production , we could probably hold where we are indefinitely , or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes ( in the sugar program ),"" Huckaby said . However , much depends on whether high - fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the U . S . sweetener market from just over 50 pct , Huckaby said . He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the U . S . But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share , then U . S . sugar imports might be eliminated and U . S . sugar output severely reduced . Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as A . E . Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon . "" This program is advantageous to the corn users . They have some natural , legitimate self - interest in seeing that the program is preserved ,"" Huckaby said . Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled , either through production allocations , acreage or marketing controls . Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production . "" I don ' t know if we will go this route , but if we do there ' s a question in my mind at this point in time ; can you do that legally ?"" he said . Asked if he would proceed with production controls without the support of corn refiners , Huckaby said "" You build a fragile house if you do it that way ."" Huckaby said he understands why U . S . cane and beet farmers have expanded production , because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain . But he said for sugar growers as a whole , expansion would not be good policy . Huckaby said he has tried to stress , in his speeches to sugar industry groups , that if growers continue to expand , they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year . Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program . "" The administration proposal is so drastic , that I don ' t think it will get up a head of steam ,"" Huckaby said . He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved . Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program , Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the European Community ' s sugar policy . He said EC policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market ."
124,"EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN AS FURTHER CONCESSION The rebates granted at yesterday ' s EC sugar tender represent a further concession to producers ' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the bloc , trade sources said . They said the maximum rebate of 45 . 678 European currency Units ( Ecus ) per 100 kilos was 0 . 87 Ecus below what producers claim is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into intervention . The rebate at last week ' s tender was 1 . 3 Ecus short of the level producers thought necessary and that of the previous week was 2 . 5 Ecus below this level . But the sources said producers who have offered a total of 854 , 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximum rebates have given no formal indication to the Commission that they intend to withdraw these offers . The French and German operators involved would be able to withdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores . The five - week period is the normal delay between sugar going into intervention and payment being made for it . EC officials have said that if the Commission has to buy the sugar , it is determined immediately to resell it , a move which could drive down market prices further ."

Japan imported 128 , 089 tonnes of Brazilian beans in calendar 1986 , Finance Ministry customs - cleared statistics show . The sources said Brazilian beans were cheaper than U . S .

The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocks are "" the first report we ' ve had for a long time that shows any optimism for anybody ,"" said John "" Bud "" Frazier , grain analyst and executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine , Inc . "" I ' m really excited about it ,"" Frazier said . The U . S .

The report showed March 1 stocks of 1 . 4 billion bushels of soybeans , 8 . 3 billion bushels of corn , and 2 . 3 billion bushels of wheat , all below trade guesses . Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann , senior grain analyst with AgriAnalysis , and Mark Meyer , a grain analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers , Inc ., on a Chicago Board of Trade panel to discuss the reports . Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendly for the market , and soybean prices would jump three to five cents a bushel "" if the bell rang right now ."" "" We ' re getting our disappearance up . We have less ( corn and soybeans ) than we thought we had ,"" he said , noting that hog and poultry production is up . "" We ' re seeing low prices generate some interest in demand ,"" said Meyer , adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and 15 pct in the preceding quarter . However , Hackmann said production could continue to exceed consumption . She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres came in southeastern states , where yields are usually low . "" We have the potential for record breaking soybean yields this year , ( which ) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow ' s opening ,"" she said . Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible , and the crop could reach 7 . 1 billion bushels , which would be down from last year ' s 8 . 25 billion bushels . "" We ' ll need very good disappearance next year to reduce stocks ,"" she said . The USDA estimated disappearance last year at 6 . 7 billion bushels . Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the long term , "" But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks down to where we could start rebuilding prices ."" Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage report could prompt farmers to change their plans and plant more soybeans . The panelists agreed that the reports should discourage talk of revising the 1985 farm bill . "" There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm law we ' re working under today , and this report should reinforce that ,"" Frazier said .

11,"U . S ., ARGENTINA SETTLE SOYPRODUCT CASE - YEUTTER U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the United States and Argentina have settled a case brought by the U . S . soybean crushing industry alleging unfair subsidies to Argentina ' s crushing industry . Speaking to an Agribusiness Education forum here late yesterday , Yeutter said the case was resolved at a meeting with Argentine Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figuerras during a trade ministers ' meeting in New Zealand last week . Under a verbal understanding between the two ministers , Argentina will soon abolish export taxes on soybeans and products , U . S . and Argentine officials said . The U . S . case brought by the U . S . National Soybean Processors Association alleged Argentina , through differential export taxes , implicitly subsidized domestic soybean crushers . The U . S . crushing industry , in its complaint under Section 301 of trade law , said higher Argentine export taxes on soybeans than on products encourage the export of products and represented an unfair trade practice . Yeutter told Figuerras that all agencies of the U . S . government supported the U . S . complaint and unless Argentina took steps to eliminate the taxes , the United States would consider taking further action in the case , U . S . and Argentine officials said . An Argentine official here said no timetable was given for removal of the Argentine export taxes ."
12,"SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER Speculation the United States will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have reached a new level of intensity in the run - up to Secretary of State George Shultz ' visit later this month to Moscow . Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat markets since officials from the two countries held their customary , semi - annual grain talks in February . Moscow ' s decision at that time to reenter the U . S . corn market strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects . Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13 . Shultz ' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement Program , EEP , coupled with the announcement of his visit to Moscow , was interpreted by many grain trade representatives here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was preparing an offer . Administration officials -- in and out of the U . S . Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight - lipped about the prospects of a subsidy offer . But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant , suggesting that an offer , while not a "" done deal ,"" is a live possibility . Prominent U . S . grain trade representatives -- many of whom asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent . Others , who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible , are saying they would not rule one out . Rep . Pat Roberts , R - Kan ., yesterday went so far as to predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks . Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials . Richard Fritz , director of international marketing at U . S . Wheat Associates , said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month . Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat . Some grain trade representatives say a four - mln - tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of U . S . corn and open the door to U . S . sales of soybeans . As ever , one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal would appear to be price . Last summer the administration took the controversial step of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds that the 15 - dlr - per - tonne subsidy still left U . S . wheat prices far above world market prices . The administration ' s decision to set the subsidy level up front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen criticism , grain trade sources said . Nonetheless , the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz from saying the Soviets were "" chortling "" because Washington was offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to U . S . housewives . The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives here is that a general warming of relations between the two countries since last summer , combined with continued hard times in the U . S . grain belt , would favor a subsidy offer . In addition , the USSR has made it clear it would consider buying U . S . wheat if it were priced more competitively . However , observers have not forgotten the circumstances surrounding the administration ' s announcement of the wheat subsidy offer last summer . Up until the time of the announcment , congressional and industry leaders were led to believe the White House had decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not only the Soviets , but also a much broader list of countries . Instead , the administration scaled back the offer to include only the Soviets . That last - minute change of heart adds a measure of uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union ."
13,"HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP Fresh , heavy rains caused further damage to the Argentine 1986 / 87 coarse grains crop in the week to yesterday , particularly in Buenos Aires province , trade sources said . They said the sunflower , maize , soybean and sorghum crops were damaged and yield estimates affected . New production forecasts were made for all these crops . The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and worsened the flooding in various parts of the province . The weather bureau said the rains , which in Buenos Aires have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days , could continue . The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains . In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of 200 mm in some parts , notably the Paso de los Libres area bordering on Uruguay . In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm in places , in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm . The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa . Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be further delayed due to dampness in the earth , the sources said . The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the crops , further dimishing the yield , the sources added . Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to 30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe , Cordoba , La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces . The production forecast for 1986 / 87 sunflowerseed has been lowered to between 2 . 2 and 2 . 4 mln tonnes , against 2 . 3 to 2 . 6 mln tonnes the previous week , making it 41 . 5 to 46 . 3 pct lower than the record 4 . 1 mln tonnes produced last season . The area sown was two to 2 . 2 mln hectares , down 29 . 9 to 36 . 3 pct on the record 3 . 14 mln hectares in 1985 / 86 . The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the area sown in Cordoba , Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires . It will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days , weather permitting . Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9 . 6 to 9 . 9 mln tonnes , against last week ' s 9 . 9 to 10 . 1 mln tonnes , down 21 . 4 to 22 . 6 pct on the 12 . 4 to 12 . 6 mln tonnes at which private producers put 1985 / 86 production . The new forecast is 22 . 7 to 25 pct down on the official figure of 12 . 8 mln tonnes for last season ' s production . The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers ' targets , against 14 to 16 pct the previous week . The production forecast was reduced to between three and 3 . 3 mln tonnes , against 3 . 2 to 3 . 5 mln tonnes last week , 21 . 4 to 26 . 8 pct down on last season ' s 4 . 1 to 4 . 2 mln tonnes . The area sown with sorghum in 1986 / 87 was 1 . 23 to 1 . 30 mln hectares , down 10 . 3 to 15 . 2 pct on the 1 . 45 mln in 1985 / 86 . The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least changed in relation to last week . It was put at a record 7 . 5 to 7 . 7 mln tonnes , against the previous 7 . 5 to 7 . 8 mln tonnes . These figures are 4 . 2 to 5 . 5 pct higher than last season ' s record of 7 . 2 to 7 . 3 mln tonnes , according to private sources , and 5 . 6 to 8 . 5 pct up on the official 7 . 1 mln tonnes . The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the sunlight needed for this crop , sources said . Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down further . The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier in the season . Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid - April in southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires ."

21,"CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings , prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets . Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program . That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low . Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign - up for reduced acreage , but they have no price guarantees . With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal , traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans , even though the new crop soybean / corn ratio of 2 . 9 / 1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances . An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross - compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop , means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized , traders said . Here too , acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats , due to the more attractive deal from the government , they added . Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago , which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton . One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans , which are easier to grow , one commercial trader said ."
22,"SOUTHERN TEXAS GRAIN DIFFERENTIALS ADJUSTED Posted county prices in 99 southern Texas counties have been changed to reflect only one market differential instead of the usual two - terminal market pricing system , a senior Agriculture Department official said .

The changes were made to better reflect local market conditions , said Ralph Klopfenstein , deputy administrator for commodity operations at USDA . "" The Texas Gulf has always been the dominant market in those counties . Amarillo never became effective for that area ,"" Klopfenstein told Reuters ."
23,"TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST Torrential rains throughout Argentina ' s grain - producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday , trade sources said . Sunflower , maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected , they said . But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May . The rains did no damage to maize , sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year ' s harvest . Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires , with the heaviest rains in the province ' s western sectors , between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba , 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa , 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe , 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios , five and 40 mm in Misiones , and five and 50 mm in San Luis . No rain was recorded in Corrientes , Chaco and Formosa . Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week ' s estimates . Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe , though slowly . Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area , compared to five to seven pct last week . Total maize area planted for the 1986 / 87 harvest was estimated at between 3 . 58 and 3 . 78 mln hectares , or two to seven pct less than the 3 . 85 mln hectares planted in the 1985 / 86 harvest . Maize production is expected to total between 10 . 4 and 11 mln tonnes , or a drop of 17 . 5 to 19 . 4 pct over the 12 . 4 to 12 . 6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates , or 18 . 9 to 21 . 9 pct lower than last year ' s volume , according to official figures . The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area . Two to 2 . 2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest , down 29 . 9 to 36 . 3 pct from last year ' s figure of 3 . 14 mln hectares . Sunflower production is expected to total between 2 . 4 mln and 2 . 7 mln tonnes , which would mean a drop of between 34 . 1 and 41 . 5 pct against the record 4 . 1 mln tonnes harvested in the 1985 / 86 harvest . Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area , which this harvest is 1 . 23 to 1 . 30 mln hectares or 10 . 3 to 15 . 2 pct less than the 1 . 45 mln hectares planted in the 1985 / 86 harvest . Sorghum production is expected to total between 3 . 2 mln and 3 . 5 mln tonnes , or 16 . 7 to 22 pct less than the 4 . 1 to 4 . 2 million tonnes harvested in 1985 / 86 . Soybean production , by contrast , is expected to hit a record 8 . 0 to 8 . 4 mln tonnes , which would mean an increase of 11 . 1 to 15 . 1 pct over last year ' s record figure of 7 . 2 to 7 . 3 mln tonnes , according to private estimates . Official figures put last year ' s soybean harvest at 7 . 1 mln tonnes . Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition , helped by abundant rains and high temperatures . Total soybean - planted area for the 1986 / 87 harvest is expected to be a record 3 . 7 to 3 . 8 mln hectares , up 10 . 8 to 13 . 8 pct from last year ' s harvest figure of 3 . 34 mln hectares ."
24,"AMERICAN FARM BUREAU OPPOSES FARM BILL CHANGES The directors of the American Farm Bureau , the nation ' s largest farm organization , voted Tuesday to urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place without alterations . "" We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill ,"" said Dean Kleckner , president . "" The current farm bill has been in place for just a little over a year and in our judgment there is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining the legislation . "" Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being advanced ,"" Kleckner said . The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans competitive in the world market . A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be eligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK certificates for the difference between 5 . 02 dlrs a bushel and the new loan rate . The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiency payments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat because of adverse weather ."
25,"USDA WOULD SCRAP COTTON , RICE , BEAN PRICE FLOORS The package of proposed farm policy changes that the Reagan administration sent to Congress today includes a provision that would eliminate minimum price support levels for upland cotton , rice and soybeans . The package , obtained by Reuters , also includes a provision , outlined in advance by USDA officials , that would increase the annual permissible cut in the basic price support levels for all major crops to 10 pct from five pct . Under current law , the basic support prices for upland cotton , rice and soybeans between 1987 and 1990 cannot be cut below 50 cents per lb , 6 . 50 dlrs per hundredweight and 4 . 50 dlrs per bushel , respectively . USDA ' s intention to propose scrapping price floors for cotton , rice and soybeans had not been disclosed previously ."
26,"FALLING SOYBEAN CRUSH RATIOS CUT OUTPUT The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks , accelerating in recent days , has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil . The weekly U . S . soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21 . 78 mln bushels , down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year . Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher , prompting a pick - up in the weekly crush number . However , much of that export demand seems to have been met , with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months . U . S . processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter , so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest , soyproduct dealers said . Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks , setting a new contract low of 139 . 70 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today . "" Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May , looking for no deliveries ( on first notice day tomorrow , which would cause March to gain on deferreds ),"" one CBT crush trader said . "" But they ' ve been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered , if not tomorrow , then later in the month ,"" he added . As a result of the weakness in soymeal , the March crush ratio ( The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans ) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22 . 6 cents per bushel today , dropping over five cents in just the last two days . The May crush ended today just over 17 cents , so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level , the trader said . Hopefully , they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand , he added . With futures down , processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans , further reducing crush margins . A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices , down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production , cash dealers said . Most soybean processing plants are still in operation , with little talk of taking temporary down - time , so far . But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins , they added ."
27,"SOYBEAN GROUP HEAD URGES USDA ACTION ON LOAN The Agriculture Department must make a decision soon on how to change the current U .

"" The USDA will have to bite the bullet one way or another ... USDA can dodge and dart around it ( the soybean loan ) as much as they want , but they have to eventually address this problem ,"" David Haggard , ASA president , told Reuters . USDA is not offering any new soybean loan options , and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has not consulted ASA on the soybean loan , Haggard said . "" I don ' t know if USDA is really very serious about addressing the soybean loan problem ,"" he said . At ASA ' s annual winter board of directors meeting here , ASA leaders refused to change their official position on the loan -- still calling for income support at 5 . 02 dlrs .

29,"INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW Indonesia "" s agriculture sector will grow by just 1 . 0 pct in calendar 1987 , against an estimated 2 . 4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines , the U . S . Embassy said in a report . Production of Indonesia "" s staple food , rice , is forecast to fall to around 26 . 3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26 . 58 mln tonnes in 1986 , according to the annual report on Indonesia "" s agricultural performance . The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26 . 7 mln tonnes , with a forecast 27 . 3 mln tonnes output in 1987 . The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1 . 5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1 . 69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks . "" Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane , rubber and copra show little or no gain ,"" the report says . "" The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans , palm oil and palm kernels ."" Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds , limited fertile land , insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops , the report underlines . The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as "" wereng "" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields . The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties , and to use lower - yielding , more resistant rice types . The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee , tea , rubber , plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices . Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7 . 0 pct in 1987 to 1 . 45 mln tonnes from 1 . 35 mln , with exports rising to an estimated 720 , 000 tonnes from 695 , 000 tonnes in 1986 , the report says . But while production of soybeans in 1987 / 88 ( Oct - Sept ) will rise to 1 . 075 mln tonnes from 980 , 000 in 1986 / 87 , imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant . The report says that imports of wheat , soybeans , soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September "" s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand . The report said that Indonesia "" s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate , the lowest rate of growth since the mid - 1960s . It compares with 1 . 9 pct growth in 1985 and 6 . 7 pct in 1984 . The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump ."

32,"BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS Brazil ' s recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987 . The developing world ' s most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans , and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets , economists said . "" That sounds like a reasonable strategy . But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation ,"" Aldo Roldan , Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics , said . Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets , but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable . "" Domestic costs have increased ( due to inflation ) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates ,"" Roldan said . The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil , where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs . But he added : "" They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels ."" Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee , and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world ' s largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance . Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) members to re - establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence . "" Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations , which others wanted changed ,"" one senior coffee dealer said . The dealer , who declined to be named , said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share . At the end of the talks , he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer . Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales , the dealer said . "" If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar , ninety or eighty cents ,"" he said . New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2 . 29 cents lower Thursday at 104 . 68 cents a lb , while more distant deliveries fell the six - cent maximum trading limit . President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute , Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas . Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped - up Brazilian marketing efforts . "" They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been ,"" according to Richard Loewy , analyst for Prudential - Bache Securities Inc . Loewy believes the foreign debt problem , a good crop , plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop . "" Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can ' t afford to store the crops ,"" he said . The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields . "" We are going to see a very rapid decline , earlier than usual , this year in our ( U . S .) exports ,"" Loewy said . Tommy Eshleman , economist for the American Soybean Association ( ASA ), said this year ' s Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes , versus 13 . 7 mln last year . Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the U . S . crop to bad growing weather . Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the U . S . government soybean loan rate , offered to farmers who give crops as collateral , Eshleman said . He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate , which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market . Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan . "" We ' re getting into a period when they ( Brazil ) are starting to harvest and starting to export ,"" Eshleman said . But he added it will be a while before U . S . exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently . Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation . He said the debt situation was a major consideration . "" The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage ,"" he added . Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops , Melicias said it would not make a big difference . On other commodity markets , Brazil ' s selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital . Brazil is faced with a poor 1986 / 87 sugar harvest , which could limit exports to the world market , analysts said . The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments , and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar , will give it little room to stretch exports , they said . Brazil ' s other major crop , cocoa , is in its third year of surplus . "" Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell , so I don ' t think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it ,"" one analyst said . "" If they come out as aggressive sellers , the market would collapse and they can ' t afford to do that ,"" she added ."

S . Embassy said in its annual report on Indonesia ' s agriculture . It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of self - sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because yields have remained below target .

Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to rise in 1987 / 88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to come on stream in early 1988 . China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share , while the U . S . Provides the rest , it said . "" This pattern will likely continue during 1986 / 87 since domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are willing to pay a premium for them ,"" it said .

40,"VEGETABLE OILS MAY TIGHTEN DESPITE SEED SURPLUS Lower production of coconut and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds , senior oilseeds analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said . Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta Agriculture ' s annual farm outlook conference that the world vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies . "" Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented decline in the production of tree oils ,"" Balletto said . Balletto estimated production of palm , coconut and palm kernel oils this year at 8 . 5 mln tonnes , down from 9 . 1 mln tonnes last year , enough to offset higher oilseed output . He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at 33 . 4 mln tonnes , up from 33 . 0 mln last year , and disappearance at 34 . 0 mln tonnes , up from 32 . 6 mln . Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply , he said , disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by 600 , 000 tonnes , the largest deficit since 1976 . "" If world protein meal demand stagnates , thus limiting the crush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing in the edible oils sector could develop ,"" he said . "" This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high oil yielding seeds ,"" Balletto said . Oilseeds , on the other hand , remain at depressed prices because of burdensome supplies , he said . World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase for the fourth straight year to a record 28 . 4 mln tonnes , compared with 25 . 4 mln last year . The increase should result from lower disappearance , as production is expected to fall to 184 . 0 mln tonnes from 185 . 7 mln last year , he said . World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98 . 9 mln tonnes , up from 90 . 6 mln the previous year , Balletto said , while production of other oilseeds was lower . Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made up for lower production in the United States , he said . Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus , and U . S . stocks make up most of those , Balletto said . The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12 . 7 mln tonnes , about half of the world soybean surplus , he said . Since 1983 - 84 , he said , world oilseed stocks have increased 13 . 1 mln tonnes . "" During the same period , U . S . soybean stocks increased 12 . 1 mln tonnes , becoming the dumping ground of the entire world surplus , courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially high prices caused by the U . S . loan program ."" "" Soybean prices and , to a great extent , world oilseeds prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program , as long as the U . S . soybean surplus continues . For the 1987 crop , he said , prices are likely to hover in a range tied to the U . S . loan program . "" Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the U . S . loan rate ."" The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially high prices encourage producers in South America , Canada and Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds , Balletto said ."
41,"BIG U . S . CONSERVATION ENROLLMENT EXPECTED Enrollment in the U . S .

Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres into the program , Milton Hertz , administrator for USDA ' s Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at a congressional hearing yesterday . Not all the bids will be accepted , Hertz said , but enrollment is expected to be high . As in the first three signups , the Great Plains area is expected to attract the greatest enrollment . "" The Great Plains area will be the predominate area which we ' ll get signup in ,"" a USDA conservation specialist said . Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of the acreage pulled from that area , he said . Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreage in the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production , but the USDA source said this would be a relatively small percent of the total . A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll part of their corn base acreage into the program has sparked more interest in this latest signup , USDA officials said .

46,"GLICKMAN PUSHES HARD FOR 0 / 92 FARM PLAN Implementation of a one - year 0 / 92 pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers another option when making their planting decisions . "" We have a budget driven farm policy . It may be a shame , but we are locked into this ,"" said Dan Glickman , ( D - Kans .), chairman of the subcommittee on wheat , soybeans and feed grains . "" We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer . A 0 / 92 plan , if properly done , could do both ."" Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0 / 92 bill for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains . An aide to Glickman said that it will probably be introduced next week . Glickman said a 0 / 92 program , which allows a farmer to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency payment , would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill -- only an extension of the 50 / 92 option already provided under the current bill . It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill , he said , but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet budget goals , a voluntary 0 / 92 plan would be better than sharply cutting target prices , as USDA has proposed . A 0 / 92 plan , however , would not be decoupling , but simply a different type of acreage diversion program , Glickman said . Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this point , he said . "" I don ' t think there is any interest in pursuing a decoupling bill this year . Period . Unequivocal ,"" Glickman said at the hearing . Sen . Rudy Boschwitz ( R - Minn .), cosponsor of the Boren / Boschwitz decoupling plan , said he supports a short term 0 / 92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan . Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0 / 92 plan in the senate . His plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to participating farmers , require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only , prohibit haying and grazing on extra idled acreage , limit participation to a certain number of acres in a county and provide tenant protection provisions . "" I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987 , but we can at least move in that direction ,"" Boschwitz said . Robbin Johnson , vice president of Cargill , Inc ., testified in favor of decoupling . Decoupling would end the current bias in U . S . farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers ' dependency on the government , he said . A 0 / 92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling , Johnson said , and would still encourage farmers to plant . Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and the National Cattlemen ' s Association said their groups oppose any 0 / 92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers . But when asked if his association were forced to choose between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0 / 92 program , Larry Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0 / 92 rather than take sharp cuts in target levels ."

Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a marketing loan for cotton and rice , but has since focused support on decoupling legislation , the Boren / Boschwitiz bill .

After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries this morning , he said the Dutch Government had indicated it would vote against the proposal , as had a number of other countries . "" Our information suggests we will have the required number of votes in Brussels to prevent the tax proposal going forward ,"" he said . "" The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20 years , and dropped every time . What we want now is to kill it once and for all ,"" Bennett added . Backing up the soybean producers ' active lobbying , the U . S . Government has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliate with penal import taxes if the proposal does get through , he said . The U . S . Government also feels it has a good case to fight the proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ), a U . S . Embassy spokesman said . U . S . Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account for one - fifth of annual production , and are worth about 2 . 5 billion dlrs a year , Bennett said . The proposed tax on oils and fats would hit U . S . Producers badly while at the same time virtually doubling the price of soyoil in the EC , which would suffer far worse than other higher - priced oils because of the nature of the proposed tax , he added . The revenue to the EC from the tax would simply be used to finance the EC ' s own oilseed subsidy machine , he said . "" We in the ASA are dedicated free - traders . We helped defeat the Wine Equity Act two years ago , but we will not stand by and watch our own farmers suffer from such protectionist EC measures ,"" Bennett said . "" The mood in the U . S .

"" We didn ' t feel a lot was accomplished last week , but we were delighted to meet with the Secretary , and he didn ' t close the door on anything ,"" a member of the soybean delegation said . At issue is the current soybean loan and the fact that at the present level of 4 . 77 dlrs ( without Gramm - Rudman reductions ) it encourages foreign soybean production by making soybeans more profitable to grow than corn . But while recognizing that soybeans are priced too high in relation with corn , soybean groups have pledged their support to maintaining current price supports for soybean growers . Leaders of the American Soybean Association and the National Soybean Processors Association offered specific loan options to USDA Secretary Lyng in last week ' s meeting , but participants would not reveal what those options were . "" There were no surprises in our package ,"" one participant said . Bandied about for several weeks has been the idea of offering producers soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates . The most prevailing scheme would be to pay a 4 . 77 loan with 77 cts worth of soybean - specific certificates which would not have to be paid back and the remaining four dlrs in cash . This would have the effect of lowering the world price , maintaining domestic support levels and reducing the government ' s soybean inventory .

Soybean production for 1986 / 87 is now estimated to reach between 7 . 7 and eight mln tonnes , versus 7 . 8 to 8 . 2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago and eight to 8 . 4 mln tonnes estimated in mid - February . But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8 . 5 to 12 . 7 pct greater than last year ' s total of 7 . 1 mln tonnes , according to official figures , and would be a new record . The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a record 3 . 7 to 3 . 8 mln hectares and increased 10 . 8 to 13 . 8 pct compared to the 3 . 3 mln hectares planted last year . The change in yield estimates is due to very high temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in the soybean - producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires province . The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean pods empty , especially in Cordoba . Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops , since rainfall was slight in most main soybean - producing areas . Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in Buenos Aires province , totalling between one and 10 mm . There was no recorded rain in other grain - producing provinces . With clear skies and seasonable temperatures , fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks , allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize , sunflower and sorghum harvesting . Crops were considered in generally good condition , though it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of recent weeks caused any long - term damage . The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the total area planted , compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago . Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at 3 . 58 to 3 . 78 mln hectares , down two to seven pct from the 3 . 85 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest . Total production for the current maize harvest is expected to reach between 9 . 9 and 10 . 1 mln tonnes , versus 10 to 10 . 2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago . The new figure is 21 . 1 to 22 . 7 pct lower than the 12 . 8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest , according to official figures . The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of total planted area , versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago . Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two to 2 . 2 mln hectares , or 29 . 9 to 36 . 3 pct lower than the record 3 . 14 mln hectares planted in the 1985 / 86 harvest . The current harvest ' s volume was again expected to be between 2 . 3 and 2 . 6 mln tonnes , or 34 . 1 to 41 . 5 pct lower than last harvest ' s record 4 . 1 mln tonnes . Yields varied widely from area to area , and growers feared that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on crops and , consequently , on total production volume . The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of total planted area , compared to four to six pct a week ago . Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1 . 2 and 1 . 3 mln hectares , or 10 . 3 to 15 . 2 pct lower than the 1 . 4 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest . Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest remained at 3 . 2 to 3 . 5 mln tonnes again this week , or 16 . 7 to 22 pct lower than last harvest ' s total volume of 4 . 1 to 4 . 2 mln tonnes ."

61,"U . S . SOYBEANS HAVE COMPETITIVE PROBLEM - AMSTUTZ Soybeans produced in the United States face a competitive price problem because of the loan rate provisions of the 1985 farm bill , U . S . Undersecretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said . Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that soybeans are caught in a "" squeeze "" because the Farm Bill allowed steep cuts in grain loan rates while limiting the soybean reduction . As a result , he said U . S .- produced soybeans "" have a price problem "" in competing with other soybean producing countries . Amstutz called the situation a "" dilemma "" for the USDA , and said "" we have spent hours in ASCS ( Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service ) looking at this ."" He did not say what may be done to rectify the situation ."

63,"U . S . DELEGATION HOPES FOR VEG OILS TAX DEFEAT American soybean producers and processors are hoping the proposed EC tax on vegetable oils and fats will not be imposed , but say the U . S . Is prepared to retaliate if it is introduced . Wayne Bennett , the American Soybean Association ' s first vice president , told a news conference the U . S . Administration would not hesitate to retaliate , but both producers and processors were trying to solve the issue through negotiation . U . S . Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng said in a letter to EC officials that U . S . Retaliatory measures would cover more than agricultural products if the tax was imposed , Bennett said . The ASA and National Soybean Processors Association ( NSPA ) delegations will meet top West German government officials today and tomorrow to lobby for support . Bennett said West Germany , Britain , the Netherlands , Denmark and Portugal oppose the tax , but Italy and Belgium seem to have taken a hardline view on the issue . "" Europeans in favour of the tax say it would be to their advantage economically , but that is not correct because we would hit back ,"" NSPA chairman Jack Reed said . This step would be very expensive for all and no one would emerge as a winner if the tax were introduced , he said . Reed pointed out the U . S . Administration and the soybean industry view the EC proposal as violating the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . The proposed tax also violates the zero duty bindings agreed between the EC and U . S . In 1962 , he said . Under the zero duty bindings pact U . S . Soybeans and products can be exported to the Community duty - free ."
64,"CONGRESSMEN URGE U . S . SOYBEAN PROGRAM CHANGES Several leading farm - state Congressmen said they will press the U . S . Agriculture Department to implement some kind of marketing loan to make soybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income . Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing , chairman Dan Glickman , D - Kan ., proposed that Congressmen and representatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the subject in the next two weeks . "" Let ' s see if we can try to push them ( USDA ) to do something without legislation ,"" Glickman told the hearing . The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4 . 56 dlrs per bushel with no income protection , or marketing loan . David Haggard , American Soybean Association , ASA , president said USDA must make changes in the soybean program . The current soybean program "" gave us the worst of both worlds ,"" ASA ' s Haggard told the hearing . The 1987 loan rate is too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of soybean production in South America , he said . At the same time , the U . S . soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income support for soybean farmers , Haggard said . "" We need some kind of market loan ,"" he added . The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA so far has resisted pressure to use the authority . Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA , but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they would seriously consider offering a marketing loan . USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the soybean situation is a "" dilemna "" which has been studied extensively by the department . But he did not say what , if any changes , are under consideration . In his testimony , Haggard indicated there are ways other than a marketing loan which should be considered to help soybean growers , such as a so - called producer option payment , or a direct payment program . Haggard said barring any program changes , Commodity Credit Corporation , CCC , soybean stocks , now at 385 mln bu , will rise to 500 mln by the end of August . A further 100 mln bu of soybeans could be forfeited between September and end - year . "" Thus , CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil ' s entire soybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987 ,"" Haggard said . However , Haggard said that the U . S . should be cautious in making soybean program changes that might allow the European Community to challenge the U . S . program under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , GATT . He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U . S . soybean production and loss of that market would be devastating . The Reagan administration has given "" mixed signals "" on whether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be successfully challenged in GATT by the EC , Haggard said . While the ASA position is to support a 5 . 02 dlrs per bu loan rate combined with a marketing loan , Haggard also endorsed a proposal by Rep . Jerry Huckaby , D - La ., which would set a six dlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan . The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking Republican on the House Agriculture committee , Rep . Edward Madigan of Illinois . Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take some action on soybeans , but cautioned that the marketing loan could mean a substantial increase in budget costs . Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one to 1 . 5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore must fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget . Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu combined with a marketing loan , the U . S . soybean price might fall to four dlrs per bu initially . This would cost the government a maximum of two billion dlrs . But he said the costs would decline as market prices recovered ."
65,"E . C . OFFICIAL SAYS FATE OF VEG OIL TAX UNCERTAIN Whether the European Community ' s Council of Ministers will approve a proposed tax on vegetable oils that has sparked threats of U . S . retaliation is uncertain , an EC official said . "" It is very far from certain that it will go through ,"" Sir Roy Denman , Head of the EC Delegation in Washington , told reporters before he addressed the Foreign Trade Association . Denman noted Britain remains opposed to the plan and West Germany has opposed it in the past . U . S . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has threatened retaliation if the tax is approved , as it would limit U . S . soybean exports to the EC . Council action is expected soon . Denman said while the EC is willing to negotiate about agriculture in a new round of trade talks , it is unwilling to single out export subsidies on a negotiating agenda or put agricultural policy on a special fast track . "" The key to a solution in this area seems to me not in the framing of the GATT ( General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ) wording ... but in tackling government subsidies to farmers on both sides of the Atlantic ,"" he said ."

Several top government officials told the American Soybean Association and the National Soybean Processors Association delegations there was no reason for American producers and processors to pay for EC agriculture , the spokesman said . European agriculture was facing severe problems , but both the Community and the U . S . Should work closely within the framework provided by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , he said . The delegations will continue their top level meetings in Bonn today but will not issue a statement before returning to the U . S . At the weekend . The EC and the U . S .

68,"LDC FOOD AID NEEDS DECLINE IN 1986 / 87 - USDA Total food aid needs in 69 of the least developed countries declined in 1986 / 87 , as requirments fell in many countries in Africa , the Middle East and Asia , the U . S . Agriculture Department said . In a summary of its World Agriculture Report , the department said grain production in sub - Saharan Africa was a record high in 1986 , with gains in almost every country . However , food needs in Central America rose , worsened by drought - reduced crops and civil strife . Record wheat production in 1986 / 87 is pushing global wheat consumption for food to a new high , and higher yielding varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat is a common crop , it said . However , may developing countries in tropical climates , such as Sub - Saharan Africa , Southeast Asia , and Central America , are not well adapted for wheat production , and improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs , the department said . World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in 1986 / 87 for the third straight year . Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil consumption , while palm oil is the most traded , the department said ."

70,"YEUTTER BLASTS PROPOSED EC OILS AND FATS TAX U .

In a statement issued by the trade representative ' s office following a speech to the American Soybean Association ' s board of directors , Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severe impact on American soybean farmers , who export some 2 . 4 billion dlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC . "" This is an unacceptable situation for us and its ( vegetable oils tax ) enactment would leave us no choice but to vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to the European market ,"" Yeutter said . Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate EC obligations under the GATT . He said the effect of the tax would be to double the price of soyoil produced from imported soybeans , making margarine made from soyoil more expensive than tallow - based margarine , and closer in price to expensive European butter . "" I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to include Spain and Portugal ,"" Yeutter said .

71,"1987 U . S . SOYBEAN LOAN SHOULD STAY SAME - AMSTUTZ Congress should give the U . S . Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybean loan rate at the current effective rate of 4 . 56 dlrs per bushel in order to help resolve the problem of soybean export competitiveness , USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said . Speaking to reporters following a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing , Amstutz suggested that one way out of the current soybean program "" dilemma "" would be for Congress to allow the loan rate to remain at 4 . 56 dlrs . He indicated if the loan rate were 4 . 56 dlrs , USDA could then consider ways to make U . S . soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to further buydown the loan rate . Under current law , the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be less than 4 . 77 dlrs per bu . Amstutz ' suggestion would be for Congress to change the farm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4 . 56 dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4 . 77 dlrs . The 1986 effective loan rate is 4 . 56 dlrs because of the 4 . 3 pct Gramm - Rudman budget cut . Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on soybean program changes will be the budget costs . He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that the U . S . loan rate provides an "" umbrella "" to foreign production and causes competitive problems for U . S . soybeans . Asked about the American Soybean Association ' s request for some form of income support , Amstutz said "" the competitive problem is the most severe ."" He said USDA is still studying the situation and "" no resolution "" has yet been found ."

73,"U . S . CORN ACREAGE SEEN NEAR RECORD LOW U . S . corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty years , Agriculture Department officials said . USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31 . Agriculture Department analysts said next week ' s figures will likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres , down 22 pct from last year ' s plantings of 83 . 3 mln acres . Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings , U . S . corn production will also decrease significantly . Analysts said 1987 corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to around seven billion bushels . Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains program , along with 1 . 9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation program , will cause acreage to plummet , Department feedgrain analysts said . "" There ' s no question that there will be a sharp decrease in corn acreage ,"" one said . "" It ' s difficult for any farmer to not go along with the program this year ."" Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but at a much slower rate of around four pct , USDA analysts said . Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below , they said , compared to last year ' s level of 61 . 5 mln acres . If analysts ' unofficial estimates prove correct then the drop in u . s . corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment - In - Kind program . Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983 . A severe drought that summer in major producing states caused yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4 . 2 billion bushels . Given normal weather conditions this year , USDA analysts said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion bushels , down from last year ' s crop of 8 . 3 billion bushels . "" This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant reduction in production ,"" an analyst said . A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U . S . corn usage , so surplus stocks , while not decreasing , would not increase significantly , a specialist said . High producing corn belt states are expected to show the greatest acreage reductions , based upon historical participation in government programs , analysts said . In contrast , soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western corn belt , a USDA soybean analyst said . "" Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge ,"" he said . Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in higher - producing delta areas . Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year ' s 2 . 0 billion bushels to 1 . 8 to 1 . 9 billion , he said . U . S . soybean acreage , after soaring to 71 . 4 mln acres in 1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that , has steadily declined in the 1980 ' s . U . S . corn acreage , with the exception of 1983 , has been in the low to mid 80 - mln acre range for the past 10 years . The highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln acres and obtained average yields of 26 . 5 bushels per acre . Last year U . S . farmers obtained record corn yields averaging 119 . 3 bushels per acre . "" We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so ,"" an analyst said . Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as long as government program provisions remain the same , analysts said . Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15 pct of their acreage . "" To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres , we would have to provide more incentives ,"" an analyst said ."
74,"ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER Argentine grain producers again reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986 / 87 soybean crop , which will begin to be harvested in mid - April , trade sources said . They said growers now forecast soybean production this season at between 7 . 5 and 7 . 8 mln tonnes , down from last week ' s estimate of 7 . 7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8 . 0 to 8 . 4 mln tonnes forecast in mid - February . The new forecast is still higher than last season ' s record total production . Private sources put 1985 / 86 production at a record 7 . 2 to 7 . 3 mln tonnes -- 4 . 2 to 6 . 4 pct lower than the new forecast for the current crop . The official figure for 1985 / 86 is 7 . 1 mln tonnes , 5 . 6 to 9 . 9 pct below this season ' s new estimates . Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe provinces and northern Buenos Aires . The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures and inadequate rainfall . Growers fear they may find more empty pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield . The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3 . 7 to 3 . 8 mln hectares , 10 . 8 to 13 . 8 pct higher than the 1985 / 86 record of 3 . 34 mln hectares . The state of the crop continued to be good in general until last week but intense , heavy rains since could have caused damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm . Where the rains were less heavy they were considered beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates . The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to influence production forecasts . In other areas , especially western Buenos Aires , where rainfall was more than 200 mm , parts of the sunflower , maize and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged . The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba , La Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios . The area sown with maize this season was between 3 . 58 and 3 . 78 mln hectares , two to seven pct less than the 3 . 85 mln hectares in 1985 / 86 . The yield of 1986 / 87 maize continued to be forecast at between 9 . 9 and 10 . 1 mln tonnes . This estimate is 19 . 8 to 20 . 2 pct lower than the 12 . 4 to 12 . 6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985 / 86 production and 21 . 1 to 22 . 7 pct lower than the official 12 . 8 mln tonnes . The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods . A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of sunshine dries the fields . The area sown this season was 2 . 0 to 2 . 2 mln hectares , down 29 . 9 to 36 . 3 pct on last year ' s record 3 . 14 mln hectares . Sunflowerseed 1986 / 87 production is still forecast at 2 . 3 to 2 . 6 mln tonnes , 34 . 1 to 41 . 5 pct below the 1985 / 86 record of 4 . 1 mln tonnes . The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the rains , advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown . The area sown was 1 . 23 to 1 . 30 mln hectares , 10 . 3 to 15 . 2 pct less than the 1 . 45 mln hectares the previous season . Yield estimates remained at 3 . 2 to 3 . 5 mln tonnes , 16 . 7 to 22 pct down on 1985 / 86 production of 4 . 1 to 4 . 2 mln tonnes ."
75,"LOWER U . S . SOYBEAN LOAN IDEA SHARPLY CRITICIZED U . S . soybean lobbyists and congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior Agriculture Department official that Congress allow the U . S . soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4 . 56 dlrs per bushel next year . "" I don ' t know who in Congress would propose that happening . Politically it would be totally unacceptable ,"" an aide to a senior farm - state senator said . USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week that Congress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan at its current effective rate of 4 . 56 dlrs per bushel rather than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4 . 77 dlrs . "" I ' m convinced that Congress will not go along with this ,"" American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said . Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if the soybean loan rate were 4 . 56 dlrs , USDA could then consider ways to make U . S . soybeans more competitive . His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the the administration ' s position is in the debate over what should be done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect soybean farmers ' income . Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices competitive . USDA secretary Richard Lyng , however , continues to maintain his opposition to a marketing loan , saying such a move would be too costly . "" There will be alot of other options that will be considered before Congress looks at that one ( the Amstutz proposal ,"" said Bill O ' Conner , aide to Rep . Edward Madigan ( R - Ill ), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee . "" Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean loan ,"" O ' Conner said . Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and decide that they cannot increase it from its current 5 . 02 dlr basic rate , but that there has to be something mandated to increase soybean ' s competitiveness , David Graves , aide to Sen . Thad Cochran ( R - Miss ) said . Cochran , a staunch supporter of a soybean marketing loan , would support a soybean loan of 5 . 02 or 4 . 77 dlrs with a certificate buydown , Graves said ."
